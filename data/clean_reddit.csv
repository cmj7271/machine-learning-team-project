another gay asexual man sounds like someone that wouldn t exist anywhere near me and i am not able to move about far,22

i ve never had this experience either i don t doubt it happens but i also think people just don t know how to deal with anxiety and use it as an excuse to ghost,32
the irony of a tra saying they can think for themselves and predicably the transphobe snarl hunty that doesn t mean shit anymore thanks to overuse,25
and i know the bible says so because someone told me so at church,14
me and my boyfriend wear the same size clothes so we share all of it it s great,17
a young,3
maybe you could talk to him about a compromise like if he s ok with it post shirtless pics but keeping your lower half and or take the pics like you would normally and only show them to him edit bottom half covered,41
so now it s the climate crisis what are geneticists supposed to do about that,14
frenz frenzy used to be one of my favorite places when i lived in kansai can t help getting nostalgic reading this hope the place is still doing well,29

some people do i keep a navy hanky in my left pocket at bars it is noticed by some,19
thank you,2
allegedly they created an office to weed out homosexuality the officers in that division supposedly went native and protected a lot of the others they discovered so if that s true then the answer is yes,35
skarner gets to join poppy galio sion and trundle in the literally deleted from the game club,17
now we can hope for the choking only way i am seeing we can secure that place,17
i think thats reasonable it used to deal way more like almost 2k iirc,14
it s a skillshot now not being point and click will free up at least some of his budget,18
get back to metashift or i ll report you,8
wanna try that again in english,6
i really dont understand people who are unironically stuck in iron like only way i see anyone being that bad at the game if they have some disability or ping,31
there s a sentence we all never thought we d hear,9
bro my friend will save of each shard before he uses them so no he does not have every champ,21
i just muted chat but kept pings and emotes on and i noticed i played better,16
i guess we need to presume him guilty,8
garen q flash ignite ult,5
its crazy how boosted junglers are where a diamond player can t understand why bot lane wants to fight level,21
yeah remove the resets on it or make it only reduce cd by half on kill or assist and make the cd longer,23
he s a literal dead pick in solo que and the nerfs to his ult lead to him being one shot in the late game,24
my sweet glorious knight wasn t trying if he was shanks would look bronze,13
lux is literally perma wr in both of her roles lets not talk about mao being legit for two months and still nearing jg after his massive nerfs lmfao,32
yeah i know that it s xerxe effect they should have resigned markoon,12
never managed to beat that one im afraid,8
plat is top percent or close yes i am play and the mmr change has brought many more smurfs and boosters that s just a fact they are infesting the game rn,32
i mean how is that a real and enforceable clause sounds like the sort of shit g2 signed with c9 which riot clearly was against,25
i dced from a game for minutes and came back and won and still got lp,17
this has been the case for most of 100t s recent games bad macro and solo lanes not able to exert any pressure,22
easy yuumi fix make attach cd seconds when hit by cc yuumi is now affected by cc that hits the ally she is attached to and unattaches boom now yuumi has counterplay,33
feels like in each game clg made at least one utterly dumb call that cost them the game unreal,19
i think you got lucky,5
is the true they never needed the items spike they we re the stronger class in the game already and the only class that have never leave the meta in the history of the game,35
the thing is we fucking hate the fucking tab way no one asked for this shit and riot still made a fucking mistake instead of doing real work,28
bard also feels your pain no assist for enemies or allies using your portals,14
think tenacity angle only works cause the map play with him on carries is worse hopefully they sort that out for international play if they make it,27
another indirect nerf to nasus my boy is gonna start having a negative wr,14
xl is the worst one they need to rebuild the whole roster hrt have some clear problems that are easy to pinpoint so should be resolved next split meanwhile i dont know what is wrong with mad,37
i am indeed pikacku faced,5
soraka s little legend pet was like where did mum go,10
it was fun,3
terrible scaling diana are you for real,7
lmao i was the wukong just unlucky,7
gori is there because there was no standout mid head and shoulders above everyone else see how he got 1st mid with only points while every other role has,31
what you doing about it yeah free pass,8
multiple articles from established journalists who have a multitude of sources from within eg and danny s family is now speculation p,21
he will need the best talented bankruptcy attorneys,8
even people who have expertise in the area probably underestimate how jank the lol code is,16
it s ok though because he s autistic or at least that is what he s said in the past to try and justify his actions,23
frosk vi cosplay x drakos caitlyn cosplay i am so hard for this brother,14
lmao so many lpl teams ahead of dk geng g copium level,13
summit v jojo int off,4
for her shadow,3
if we do have a way tiebreaker it s looking like eg have locked 6th,15
yeah i hope we get a comment from a rioter on this i do not want another year of ashen skins especially when they ve shown they re only giving ashen skins to male champs,33
ruby looks actually good on ahri,6
if he would do better than meta adcs then he would be meta thats why other adc are meta and he is not and you cant allways pick a apc unless you have ad dmg somewhere,37
riot explained a while back they did that to a few mage items as a psuedo durability update and have been hesitant to undo it and risk making mages op,30
i play xiv with a controller gt gt,7
my favourite change to the game was when they updated summoner s rift my least favourite change was a few patches after they added yuumi where i finally came to the conclusion that i hated the champion,36
both but nowadays he s been their regular guys on english broadcast analyst desk,13
i believe in informalmarch supremacy,5
looks like male taliyah lol i don t really like the disney design for champs but hey as long as the gameplay is good it might aswell be a walking turd gameplay gt gt design any day of the week,38
i like what you re cooking up,6
and then they also tried the t1 baron themselves game lol it was lost anyway but still funny to see,21
your going to get out macroed hard and lose a lot of games you will still win some based on your adc carrying or your jungle but you won t have a good time,33
nautilus is about miles more awesome than pyke anyways feaarr the deep,13
ohh okay gotchu tbf tho longer q is a lot more convenient for taking towers,15
just unbind eylas flash,4
yeah garen is really suffering right now after all the systemic nerfs to fighters,14
don t speak so soon vit could very well lose every single game from now on due to investing too much resources into botlane or due to personality issues from the new adc or any other reasons i might have missed,40
its not as bad as when that discussion was going around its back to at least,17
not grouping them just examples,5
i was never talking about level aurelion but aurelion s e on level,14
academy holy shit what a god,6
they resurrected the cat just to start beating her to death again it s quite hilarious how they try to dance around the problem,23
did you watch the other weeks,7
it rotates between most of the cast more specifically the play by play casters it s like pbp to color to counting letigress sierra is only a host for the crew,32
gt it builds upon your own communication skills as you find new and exotic words to avoid the automatic chat filter u mom go sky,24
post rank noob,3
well sheesh then cuz it s dead af,8
just another circle of suck,5
nah man i cant with redditors,6
especially after his initial interview at the beginning of the split where he said that he was happy that he finally had teammates that knew what they were doing,29
i d rather the west send their best teams rather than sending a bad team for it to be funny we ve already seen kr cn teams destroy weak western teams,28
well yeah it s obviously a mental thing and humans do float by default but you have to orient yourself correctly to breath and such,24
both games also have an item named guinsoo guinsoo s rageblade for lol and guinsoo s scythe of vyse for dota,20
ast is full ad with aa dependant damage,8
he looked like he was high on cough syrup yesterday,10
please airlift jankos and jack out of this fucking team evi plays like he only realized q has a wind up every time he presses the damn button,27
better retirement home wins,4
really mine has been amazing,5
probably season 7ish for me not for any gameplay ranked system reasons just felt like the community was less deranged back then and there was more fair games,27
i don t know what copypasta this is but i chuckled,10
mid or feed,3
lets be honest with the power of lord morgan bro easily clears those plebs,14
with the total number of the wins i thing geng would be on number two place,16
bench closer please like so sick of the ego lee sin when he can t even perform on stuff like sejuani,20
not a thing anymore,4
bro take the l he s right there are people who hit challenger playing every champ if you look over the course of a season,24
you could be the owner of riot and challenger but i d still have you on your knees if i played vayne against you,24
actually good game by the whole th roster but they woke up kinda late no,15
princes s back finally broke and probably his mental with it,10
it actually matters a lot if that midlaner is leblanc or fizz or some shitty midlaner that happens to deal magic damage,22
he has true damage penetration and should kill tanks in melee range and not be deleted by them tanks should not deal as much damage as carry while being tanks,30
they really fucked up some people i also get,11
what about the game experience from ur one trick pony without his main xd,14
pretty much he had solid games throughout but he inted at the end but like game issues and all,20
3rd t1 vs geng lck final in a row incredible dominance,11
kinda not so true iam playing it and it works just fine,12
this is one reason why frost fire gauntlet is go good on her now w onto them they are stuck in the slow field then you can e them easily,30
poor lep imagine you get to go to worlds from a minor region and this is what people remember,19
it was a mistake but it goes both ways sejuani shards disenchant for be costs in shop mf and leona both disenchant for both cost in shop,31
yone being blind picked in pro is proof yone is not bad right now,14
i mean im getting 50lp per win in silver and i m not complaining,13
ward hopped flashed and then q d back in,9
i see what you did here,6
lol what a throw by clg c9 win thanks to zeri getting a free ramp up from sion just ban zeri so their adc actually has to do work,31
dude doesn t even need the gold from minions,8
they re beating all the teams in na,7
just morons voting based on team standings as usual,9
screens worth of range,6
vicla played really well this series can t wait for the rematch in finals,13
half bad is an understatement it actually performs way better than ap winrate wise just needs to be the right kind of game,23
merge eune and euw,4
and what about the changes without notifying us nautilus,9
i think with doublelift and closer drawing so many bans his champion pool being smaller probably isn t so much of an issue maybe teams shift that approach though,28
razork dodge a hook challenge impossible,6
they retconned that a while back she s but displaced timewise so she warps around timelines and dimensions for fun instead of just being alive that long,28
watch mad fnc,6
same story as on tsm two best lcs players of all time are carrying him yet he needs the carry counterpick and all of the junglers attention,27
theshy s playbook leaked and it was just fuck it we ball written on all the lines and margins,18
that guy won something at some point,7
they have a higher ceiling alright just missing the walls the door the support the foundation pretty much everything under the ceiling,22
if that s him the match history makes it look like this post reminded him about leagues existence,17
super fair point here,4
i d rather someone call me a slur than trolling in terms of gameplay,13
iirc lng and edg have really rough schedules left though don t they i wouldn t be super worried about jdg either way even if they played an extra bo5,28
blah blah didnt read and ill keep abusing adc on sololanes until mages get fixed,15
git gud,2
i m not ashamed to admit i have played viktor for hours while listening to a second loop fem his verse in this is war or same with mid graves and big iron,34
lol is mark trying not to laugh,7
man knows he s gonna get blamed whether it s his fault or not,12
agreed,1
dive,1
aww a russian man with his boys,8
fudge always had amazing fundamentals it s why ls likes him so much and has had such high expectations for him he just needed the experience,25
what happened top did he just get gapped or did he roam or something,14
these frauds better predict 100t to make playoffs or i will take drastic action,14
when you have very strict limits for storage but less strict requirements for in memory processing this can be the case for embedded devices extremely low bandwidth networking protocols and high performance serialization formats,32
he s not blind pick if you pick him into aps ure in very bad time lets not talk about pro these people picked ryze when he was wr it has nothing to do with soloq,37
when s mvp all pro get announced,5
not really in fact most of the korean viewers agreed with this perspective adc from 5th team does not deserve all pro viper himself eventually failed to carry his team and score a victory against strong teams as well,38
very debatable polymorph is worse than a stun and there are other point n clicks stuns gwen w renataa w are better candidates as they have similar and comparable effects to other ultimates in the game,36
pick rakan do nothing doesn t look like it s working out at all,12
yes but a stomp toward the end of the season means way more fq is sadly falling off a cliff in recent weeks,23
i m more surprised about zed than yasuo,7
i guess for that guy intern at dig gt award winning journalist,10
i love your flair,4
winning winter means you get a spot in the season finals you could literally finish 10th in both spring and summer and still potentially qualify for worlds that alone means its enough,32
zeka kingen and apparently clid have an unknown buff called t1 s bane which allows them to absolutely outbrain t1,19
good guys sk trying to make up for delays yesterday,10
lol i ve learned to pick my battles with the league community sometimes you gotta settle with tournaments featuring only women are a good thing lmao,25
seconds in already making aids and cancer jokes did u even try,13
aww feels like anytime fnatic get stressed they immediately forget protecting their adc,13
yuumi in the 30k tier is comical,7
the c9 vs rogue was the one perkz carried on leblanc right,12
i dont remember the specific dev that commented on it but i do remember they said they were gonna chill on the skirmishers for awhile since they have been releasing so many so you should be good,37
same with sivir i m eating well when a yuumi is picked,11
i m gonna guess braum edit i was right,8
t1 going with the ls picks now,7
nasus infinite scaling is a falacy and isnt really even true or feel true until like an hour and a half,21
varus broken early good fits into every teamcomp has cc can go poke can go tank kill can go normal adc,21
stookbeer did say in his post i m honestly not sure if i m just completely disgusted by the scam he managed to pull off or just impressed that he managed to actually do this for months before someone found out,40
predicting miky flash if he did flash everyone would praise him,11
the alternative is consequence free gaming why is a 5k ahead ocean soul team getting aced with the waves at base 100t would only lose very little for running it down if fly didn t get bounties,36
jackspectra is literally always in melee range ruby does nothing and evi is chain inting good lord what did jankos do to deserve this,24
they re basically elimination matches so maybe that does it for him,11
he s always down on tank v tank matchups too i just think he simply misses creeps more often than others when he shouldn t i don t think it s super complicated,29
us is not white lmfao,6
easiest way to test is just uninstall blitz then try to load in,13
i mean he basically went the xqc route of saying twitch emotes random one liners and making noises makes sense to copy the biggest streamer so no flame,28
where was this hans in lcs man,7
i m excited for the change it s always been a situational item on morde when you re ahead but having haste back might make it a solid 2nd item again,28
they are an ivern main if anyone s going to care about this it s someone who relies on a pet,19
you don t understand what fundamentally broken means,7
i agree while it was fun watching ruler not long ago single handedly denying to lose the game when you realise it s damn zeri gaming it takes all the excitement away,30
newest team building activity,4
i see the bausffs have it on when live there s an option for sure,14
he doesn t work because no one wants to play him mid when trist lucian vayne are better solo adc,17
irelia is hot,3
really hope doesn t go international they will be shit on so hard,13
just calling out the shameless fnatic bad upvotes to the left yeah we kinda suck right now some of it inexcusable but some of it is circumstantial this is nothing like breaking point though,34
yeah his ults onto vi then later veigar in botlane were fight winning,12
i ve had like four friends join this game over the span of the last months so i would say yes from personal experiences,24
let s just all be happy mad didn t randomly win that winter final,12
first episode i think lol amazing show though didn t expect it to be so good,15
the skt vs rox game where bengi subbed in to play nidalee,12
doss and oscarinin competing to see who can lose their team the game,13
why ast beat them,4
winsome was the problem,4
luger just completely useless this series,6
i think jinx is bugged players are not able to use their flash when playing her for some reason,19
he twit he was depressed but being replaced isn t his choice,11
look at facts bro link op gg and add notabricklayer or stfu,12
i m amazed you care,4
that s perfect thank you,4
yo he actually made it to gold i remember him hardstuck bronze,12
oh shit it is on netflix thanks for the suggestion the passing of time has made me miss the ya female protag dystopia novel genre,25
a lot of luck plus there was no reason to rocket after landing e lots of missed qs but still fun,21
huh why do you think gabby is rich lcs casters are not making great money,15
eh valdes atlus and chronicler are all good i dunno about valdes solo carrying it,15
no she picks the location for any unit or dagger that s the little circle in her targeting indicator,18
that has nothing to do with what i said,9
cant talk badly about reddit champs yorick based yuumi bad,10
because you focus on the video and idc about the video when i literally talking about moment,18
spring when summit was 1v9ing every game in the regular season you can always read things,17
luger robbed from all pro,5
not troll chief troll king king,6
hmm what a coward,4
true but the lane was over when cait lost flash,10
i know but still there has to be a change in approach or players,14
then it becomes something super subjective because reddit hates it but twitter has shown her love for it it then becomes something you can t have an objective view around,29
hired gun lucian feels try hard as fuck i used to exclusively use that skin when lucian top was a thing,21
yeah she is just healthy for pro play,8
i thought i was mid,5
thorin isn t banned and the other guy definitely should be,10
outside of flandre lpl tops have been able to handle beat zeus their teams have the best chance,17
this unless flyquest win grand finals i assume they are going to bring winsome back,15
it s not even that though they actually have been posting less after they said they would communicate then before,19
szygenda totally gapped bb his best performance in the lec,10
carzzying,1
pulsfire ezrael sux ass his spell effects are literally worse than the base skin and the level up changing the model is nothing spacial if you ask me it should cost 975rp,32
this thresh gameplay is melting my mind,7
she got put in hard teamcomp there is a reason not mobile champs are paired with enchanters or tk,19
there is absolutely enough time for every pro to pick up more champions than what s in the meta junglers have been playing vi wukong for a year now they don t need another thousand scrims on them,36
so basically the yuumi remake we asked for but named milio got it,13
that s a ton of the bigger pbe focused lol content he s hardly alone in that,15
but he popped off late game lmao,7
been using my championship ward from season for all these years never felt the need to change,18
how many of those people were league of legends players though,11
him and baelulu honestly lol,5
fudge has truly elevated himself to a lck top laner level his kennen in team fights reminds me of canna absolutely useless,22
i wouldn t really call ezreal easy,6
probably the normal buyouts european teams set something around billion euros,12
veigar kassadin and karthus,4
i don t know how many more kt series like this i can take surely they have taken years off of my lifespan by now overall clean series tho,29
vulcan doing a bit of tomfoolery,6
even tho fudge had a bad worlds his world s and msi was great he held his own against nuguri who was carrying the lifeless void of fpx that year,31
that s fine level is not important for ashe s,10
not in a sidelane as zed with cleaver grudge does have the damage to kill jayce and jayce hammer form cant really get damage onto zed,26
thats i thought not like solo and chime werent perma throwing but maple probably carries with liandries full screen abilities not sure what 100t would do against that,28
sure bro i can quit whenever i want i promise,10
the team is very good at pick the right players idk how beishang is a free agent while some like h4cker have teams,23
doesn t faker spend very little money the fucks he going to do with this he s already loaded and doesn t spend it,21
probably not native english speaker is my guess,8
yeah but she got that succ,7
i honestly cannot believe we re still talking about old graves on this sub new graves has been in the game way longer at this point just move on y all,30
you should read the tos about that,7
as far as i can tell the team with the better champ composition will always win that s my aram experience,20
sure but ashe has heal and ignite is down if leona goes in a second time there s a good chance hle at least go for,27
source trust me bro,4
i don t know exactly how it works but i ve found that you re more likely to get the mitigation if you wait until closer to,25
i m too invested in lol esports haha got them all except the astralis rogue one,15
daang didnt know league had rtx already,7
yea never forget the summer c9 incident,7
she s way less oppressive as a top laner when she s against actual heavyweights as opposed to jumping mages at lvl and pegging them with her passive,27
blg is inconsistent as fuck bin only plays carry top laners for the most part and yeah they re too inconsistent to win it all i wouldn t want an inconsistent team representing lpl at msi,34
i used to pray for times like this,8
years btw,3
bruh i literally got my most played champ wtf,9
she may not be removed from the game but she s removed from my games i m the same way tbh,19
little did they know trading ksante for caitlyn flash level actually dooms top instead of bot,17
ok go next,3
so happy for star guardian orianna definetely her best skin,10
ssg fans really think one lucky year etc etc,9
well you are a smart teamplayer you don t find this often in solo q but it s nice when a team works together to overcome an unfavourable draft instead of raging,30
eune is still well europe lol,6
of course the toxic cat gets an incredibly broken buff,10
he s talking right now,4
zed99 turns off character inking which is basically a black outline on champions to improve visibility it should be in the video settings under character inking or something of the sort nothings actually changing the size just a visual queue,40
daisy just had adhd or maybe she s on the spectrum she ll just decide to go fucking crazy sometimes then back to normal,22
have you seen renekton into malphite renekton is completely useless against malphite every time that matchup appears renekton gets ass blasted,21
in season there was a much smaller gap between pro play and regular play things will never be perfectly balanced between both because they re so different,27
first time,2
honestly kinda could go either way really haha both were something,10
thanks for the link,4
with ludens you are not forced into the precision tree and its a good dmg item just feels unusual to build ludens on an assasin,25
vit had the extinction buff with asol vs chogath,9
cheers geoff,2
this is actually one of the worst casts i ve ever heard lt and raz have absolutely no hype or synergy or game knowledge i like raz on the desk but this is not it for casting,36
this makes so much sense as it s annoyed me everytime,10
ya last time i logged on it was unlocked however it looks like the basic one if i chose not to select anything so the visual is gone now,29
for the talent they have they are not that good but then again their roster is also too stacked to be bad in this league,25
i mean ah is pretty useless but doesn t this make that build path a little better also her cds are the longest early so maybe getting codex as first component wouldn t feel as useless lol,35
renata s,2
beryl won worlds and went to finals with another team he might have checked out but not too much,19
agreed it s very silly that i have to limit the number of champions i own just to avoid getting skins for them,22
sure why don t the pros do this instead of use voice chat in league of legends tournaments,17
yeah that s my guess too,5
would you be willing to share your page,8
no way solo is getting the bag so i doubt its about pay i would be very surprised if anyone beisdes maple is making anything significantly more than minimum idk what op is on about,35
it s a joke about how hard jojo was inting the game after being given a big lead,17
where tf are y all that people keep doing this like legit question i barely see anyone question ping anymore much less use the bait ping but that s all reddit seems to talk about is this like a high elo thing or,41
you have to play games to stay in masters no low elo players would be able to sit there unless you pay someone to keep you there at which point it s really just the alt account of a challenger player,40
everyone just ignoring where he said if there s no valid target selected,12
even running it down can be very productive if the team clicks hylli sometimes people just play together better even if another player is supposed to be better,28
apex salaries for pros just barely hit 2k a month the reason they won t drop their apex team is that they have hal s stream numbers,25
remember people you hyping vicla yeah,6
that s what he said,4
so has doublelift,3
then the botmakes start putting them in shifts and nothing changes,11
oscarwin,1
fly has been on a decline tho we forget that 100t is a stacked team as well,17
this only applies to squishy melees like yasuo high range mobile champs you ll either need setup tools like the shitty chemtank or you ll lose all your hp before you reach the high mobility champion,33
eg,4
and this is why you shouldnt talk about the things you dont have a fucking clue about op is just majority of lol players knows nothing about coding working game overall but still has a knowledge and a plan lmao,40
nice points thank you very much,6
or milio can just farm,5
he can into specific match ups but he s never going to stop lane the utility of his ult banner and shield means he ll always move into a supportive off tank type role come mid game,35
that s cause media needs to push narratives and has biases the teams don t have to save face they can be quite blunt about the fact that they unabashedly respect the fuck out of c9,34
i actually think this is a perfect all pro team for this split i wouldn t change anything,16
pax sivir,2
its actually crazy that i already know that we will see razork and humanoid together for the rest of the year meanwhile their last game in the same team should have been at worlds,34
eyla not flashing when zven flash renata d him seemed really weird to me not like it s a fast moving skill shot was he dead even if he flashed it,28
i think he actually peak in spring,8
wow months ago you would get shishkebabed for even suggesting this with the same reasons lmao,17
you mist be watching some weird games if you think that is true shaker hasnt won lane in years chovy and bdd are muxh better laners and teamfighters than faker,30
well i was expecting this team to just stomp playoffs and then msi so msi would be boring as fuck but now i doubt that,25
bwipo wants to stay in na alphari is taking a break this year and wunder was just benched however i do agree heretics could definitely use nemesis abbe with wunder top,30
gt it didn t make me mad or anything wants to report it to their boss to get them in trouble makes a whole post about it argues in the comments refusues to post opgg lol ok bud,36
i think they really like coordinating a ton of cc in pro play to players but like there are three tanks on gg if ever there were a time eg needed some extra carry damage,36
conq gore mercs black cleaver maw barely made deaths dance and gg idk if i should post my opgg because im getting flamed here,24
that was the best lck game i ve ever seen do not ride the rollercoaster,14
brand or zyra every single game don t troll pick some ls level stuff in bronze and throw down some wards its not hard,24
thank fucking god,3
yes that s literally its whole thing what you see is what you get it s very powerful,16
play him for the next games of ranked and report back to us then maybe you can answer that question yourself by then,24
dhokla putting in work late game,6
therefore confirming that point amp click stun is not the problem,9
well played by to use the wave top to get some advantage back,14
he was so unique i get it it s impossible to fix bugs or whatever but i wish they had tried to instead of completely changing him,27
targamas didnt bring the best mood to the team as you can see in their behind the scenes videos,19
yeah its just a question idk,6
that failed reverse yone schooling attempt,6
i would say i ll never do this cuz i ll never buy seraphine but the real reason i ll never do this is because i can t win on of the champion roster,31
absolutely love the chat messages from the team,8
cheese warding a common spot,6
litterally what low elo players complain about getting ass banged of a backdoor it s a game to win who cares about how you do it jesus,26
i think it s different at high elo from a lot of the people i watch from things like team comps and counter picks getting good at dodging helps it saves your mmr which is the main thing,37
i m using plat plus u gg riot endorsed sat site,9
if you were actually paying attention you d see he was winning it until ashe had to use all her sums off of getting hit by rakan w and then after that it was 1v3 being zoned off waves all game,40
pawn more like,3
that s not what you shouldn t do with such advantage but again of he s not ready he shouldn t be there,19
okay that s true i just want to see t1 sweat just a bit they re not going to msi looking like gods it s the same thing last year and they got burned in front of their people,36
she s play by play isn t she,6
girlgamer didn t organize regional events for cn or na also technically it s not exclusively a kr slot since the daejeon tournament also had teams from hong kong and thailand,29
i just dont like mad and find the drafting of g2 photon bo and upset internationaly better than chasy elyo and carzzy so i want g2 and vit at msi,30
oscar is such a fucking chad instead of helping his team win the clearly favorable fight they set up mid under azir turret he just goes for the nexus the balls on that man,34
is there any news on the worlds format because if it s double elim i just don t see anyone beating this team twice,22
berserker legit flashing into everyone at the end,8
solo actually started the autoattack on the blastcone to go back in but cancelled it quickly enough that could have looked really silly,23
do you have bitdefender turn off exploit detection in advanced settings did the trick for me,16
sorry to hear that but you are just wrong though adc is really strong role now only jungle is stronger because the jungler can gank the adc and make it fed and then take drake,35
i would be getting shit done and treatments done if the cost for it was as cheap as korea lmfao american prices are a fucking scam and they re not as good as korea,33
kcorp fans everyone was flaming striker every thread here about kc was always saying his drafts were ass and when you see the narrative around kc here these comments weren t made by kc fans,34
being forced to pick a fear champion just to counter one specific champ is bad design if a champion is forcing another specific champion to be picked theres a huge problem,31
does anyone know what happened with that it is crazy though that he legit disappeared once that happened,18
yeah if they gave her an axe her pr would skyrocket,11
you don t need to go that far hans won lec winter split last week lol,15
they got a 2v2 kill and played teamfights pretty well what more do you want him to do,18
cmon man there are many spaniards in berlin but there no way that mad has this many fans,18
and that s what they did before the format added something close to relegation no,14
i guess she doesn t look real and detailed enough she s also not really fast for me fast spiders are the worst ones,22
seems like a bit of a bait to me especially the senna supports that buy it and never proc it for half the game i don t know what they re smoking,30
they should get jankos bringing the elo helled grandpas together,9
i mean yeah could also just show career highlights of the star players,13
oh my god is right,5
i feel you miss my old mid nida she was op but i just can t stand to jungle,18
yes sometimes and appeared on their podcasts but mostly i was baked into their twitch deal which they still had at the time,23
kt won both series against geng so i can see kt taking them down if they do meet up in the lower bracket,23
lol tl aint making that either,6
it would need to be a bo3 or something as much as i love random it doesn t make for accurate ranking,21
most likeable metalhead,3
it might just actually be op lmao,7
personally i think anyone who says that an entire class of champions is broken is just ignorant of the role,20
can qeue game pops but nothing happens when i press accept,11
i m not sure which part of that is the bug you think is happening did you know her ult makes the tentacle hit boxes go away,26
idk the hextech one is pretty fun,7
any chance we can make the starting hexgate to tier two tower next,13
we will not be removing draft norms it s a great way for players to practice for ranked and permaban yasuo yuumi blitzcrank shaco,20
that one loss probably means they get geng in round,11
smh tenacity,2
they might have banned renata but we still givin them the berserk,12
i doubt mid is the most important position in this meta,11
when he got reworked i played him ignite and duskblade top it was op and broken,16
lider is the goat i like he picks no meta champs and does it well,15
i woudn t say probably mitchell garland alone is a great rival,10
gt i really miss s league laning back then felt so much more important than now too,16
gragas by far i missed him so much,10
code red boiz jankos jarven its happening,7
yes d,2
it s not unbalanced vladimir missed a bunch of exp and sylas got more problem solved,15
the problem is that at some point he has to play a decent laning phase honestly if he somehow fixes that he is serviceable even internationally but this laning phase will lose games against top teams,36
how about to stop paying ridiculous salaries having ridiculous facilities and recruit players that have personalities instead of imports who barely mesh in with the culture the ridiculous buyouts and insane contracts for these players was always unsustainable,38
haven t the tcl given like a shitton of big players their start caps bwipo closer bb,16
there is no bribe involved the chicken is the code needed to activate sleeper agent cuzz,16
its cool that the patch notes say he will be out the 22nd and they just dont realease him clown company as always,23
navori should be 15for melee you aimed at adc but hurt melee such as tryndamere,15
cheers to valdes come a long way since team salmon you ve gone from awkward duck caster to awkward duck caster but with a shitload of game and on air experience so it s just your style,34
that is his smurf acc but i will add it too thank you,15
hope it goes better than bjerg and core,8
lmao imagine being so poor yku waste your time on this,11
he s just humble saw him clap faker on his smurf the other day,13
the games start at cest today,8
i miss the era of champion design lore now everything is anime marvel disney and the new characters are all one dimensional with only reworked champions still being interesting,27
1st all pro is best players in the league sure bds works well as a team but except adam noone deserves it and he will get exposed like last split in b03,32
wait you can t get pax sivir anymore well shit i should have sold all those codes when i had the chance i found like of them in a box in the back of a closet like years ago,40
is that why their wr is always horrible on release a player tilted on champ they know shouldn t play bad unless they re just a bad player,26
ooh sounds like you need a napnap and a juice,10
dark star shaco i remember of them that wasn t absolutely destroying my team every other time they have been such a pain in the ass,26
i thought the same surely it s aurelion if full duration counts,11
amethyst ashe it was my first skin and for some reason it feels way smoother than the other ashe skins i have used,24
i was making a joke my guy relax,9
both astralis games have unironically been insane so far first was like the perfect controlled minimal mistakes macro game vs koi second was just raw mechanics super grug facesmash game where they ate g2,34
i really feel for rekkles man what the fuck was that boosted lvl by advienne disgusting the rest are just terrible as well fnatic needs an insane rebuild kick everyone from players to org besides rekkles,37
played multiple games of morgana amumu with a friend and thought it was really op since we kept winning,19
fnatic vs omg worlds groups is maybe one of the most hyped games i ve ever seen,17
oh thank you for explaining,5
state peak or dont comment on elo ty,8
2nd game has to play gp top not sure how hard you wanna throw your rookie under the bus,19
life is that bad for you,6
aurelion s passive scales his damage very well tho it s not like it doesn t exist,14
hard to tell how much this will effect champs since half the damage you take anyways is from item effects which these don t change,24
are u switching to recommended runes by accident idk apart from that,12
love how blitz is x but orianna isnt theyre both robots my guy,13
i want to like her and i m sure she s a great person but i don t think she s ready to be casting lcs yet,23
i ve hated g2 ever since they made pyke everywhere a thing but i have to admit i have a soft spot for how creatively they will draft,27
ardent cancer,2
is that nepotism or is he trying to find cheap pickups from a region that can have some bright sparks did you know there is more turkish players in the lcs than na players that s not nepotism na just sucks,40
hi core big fan what would you like your life to look like after you are done playing professionally,19
yes and it sucks in the lec so my point stands dont pick it,14
he just jealous just unfriend him,7
please for the sake of my mental expand on her design is counter to the entire concept of a moba,20
imagine how privileged your life must ve been to be sitting there and complaining about keyboard noises like holy you ve never seen trouble dude xd,24
lmao they weren t bad to the point where they dropped from gg dropped out of upper bracket,18
i gotchu,2
100t is so bad omg,5
nah that s unrelated,3
somehow i doubt reddit could come up with a worse iteration of yuumi,13
bot diff lt,3
where are the people laughing about a fnc dream what about today,13
ahh gnar that both makes sense and makes no sense at all lol,13
i actually tried it i m waiting for the repatch to finish but the client is still not loading,18
and giving extra dash to adc s but removing it from others somehow is balanced,14
is that why they benched him at worlds finals for juhan,11
mad lions vs rogue game summer playoffs what a fking game a 10k gold deficit and mad pull off the victory so easily,25
i mean credit to hans but that champion is just so disgusting he just gets so much gold from a single kill and has so much power early and mid you can just ff,34
still riding on the gensniper hopium he is our lebron,10
genuinely always worth watching,4
would argue photic was not that inconsistent and he was the main carry plenty of times also v5 looked alot better than whatever i ve seen of tes last games v5 did not lose to mid and bottom tier teams,40
vitality is a weird one as they bought giants entire roster that got promoted,14
casting was worse then the eg draft,7
farmland saga but they actually implement farming as olaf s passive,10
absolute comedy i never stopped thinking that kt would throw so therefore they won you re welcome kt fans,18
i have literally looked for a post having that information but i guess my bad,15
i d like to but he procced pta and my entire body has evaporated,13
i m good with it gaining but only losing not too bad,13
gt this is karma s best skin so far holy it would be a shame if it wasnt it is a legendary,21
me zooming in everywhere not finding the other characters,10
on one hand the language barrier definitely makes it more confusing but i also think the barrier made him more willing to go along with the antics lol hilarious episode either way,31
yeah but i can just imagine the shit show of a player getting benched for mental health going on social media to say they re fine and that it s bullshit they re being benched,32
he is probably talking about this specific clip which has no towers for the backdoor bonus to apply and not the general question asked about why you need minions to push for end,33
can you update the dfm and sengoku gaming ones for the ljl i know its a minor region but one of those teams are going to msi so it would be cool to update them,35
we are winning it all this split lfg,8
it is but you don t get paid or not as much,11
gt it didnt count eather yeah some challenges just don t trigger in matches has been an issue since challenges were released isn t related to the issue about your crystal total not increasing,32
tp strat was cool when you re trying to get feral flare asap,12
he ulted vi like times didnt really change anything tbh he just resurrected and died again,17
reason for why i don t play ranked and don t care about rank,13
c9 vs clg is always a banger doesn t matter how bad or good the teams are at the time for whatever reason one plays to the others level lol,29
humanoid played almost perfectly for minutes got a great individual lead then he makes mistake and zed is ahead in gold i love the bounty system,28
seems like its just a short clip from the original video odd for it to be its own post,19
jdg is better than lng,5
one of the amateur teams won one of the proving grounds back in,14
thank god that zilean was punished and finally 100thieves one dimensional style was exposed,14
why does she even have that ability,7
i think it will likely be because two years is probably enough what category the champ will fall into but we could have champs going straight from the expensive tier to the lowest,33
please don t choke again,4
holy shit that was pathetic demoralizing for an eg fan,10
join fnc our mental is already fucked so you ll fit right in,12
well considering he regularly had peter dun the head coach of eg on his shows,15
no the only change is to tabi s own buff the tags of all these attacks are unchanged,17
he will next patch prolly i actually have seen hecarins pop off more than him tho,16
nah u just enjoy freelo,5
thank you thorin,3
my plat ass could probably get master duoing with rookie lmao,11
okay but let s be real right they nerfed lethal tempo because the range it gave was too strong so why are we giving a support extra range on max level w,32
i lost duel to trynda cuz he has like hp and i though that he ulted and he ulted just when i was about to hit him again sec later,32
bros a fucking alien,4
while it d help the outcome was decided super early this game they were down like 5k at 16minutes into the game basically life running it down early dug the grave for this game sadly,35
samira azir gnar,3
that s simply how it is,5
upset played way beter than kobe tho but insane jgl sup dif once again,13
not a nerf lmao what sure his w r might drop a smidge but this champ is still going to be batshit bonkers failure of a rework,26
or invisible twitch which imo is the worst,8
i don t think anyone here is saying bjerg is playing well but some are acting like he s the worst player in the lcs right now because this sub has a hate boner him,33
dude the cast has been so uninterested in 100t s doing anything decently lol i mean i get it of the most winning players on one team but like really,30
abyssal guard and marai songstress are her bf and gf named loto and tama,14
nah dude youre just dumb af its fine to play off meta picks when they make sense ap on hit rakan does not in any way make sense,28
hope is not allowed,4
evi s gonna continue getting a fuck ton of hate even if he smurfs most costreamers liveviewers just fucking despise him and have their viewers just parrot the same hate,28
dhokla gt licorice dhokes has so much more upside even if he has int games licorice is plays without a brain all game,23
this happens to me and i m in premade with my friends in a discord call,15
i installed about a month back played poppy into an olaf and saw my tank champion die in a few autos and i just kinda stared at the screen wondering what the fuck happened lmao,35
don t apologize not having empathy is not a crime you just shouldn t be allowed to decide politics,17
wasn t there some kind of convergence between na and lec overlays,12
ah another person who thinks merc threads is the ap version of steelcaps and reduce magic damage beyond the magic resist base component,24
flair checks out,3
literally any profession can do that that s the fucking law,10
cringe responding to comments over a month old na will be taking notes internationally like always bud,17
gt rumors this isn t a rumor it s published reporting by richard lewis give the man fair credit,17
it s south korean celebrity culture the positive alternative is fans sending food trucks that have snacks drinks w nice messages some actors post their food trucks all the time,28
imagine oner with mid chovy knight rookie calibre,6
getting lec checked oof,4
i ll have to watch some youtube highlights lol thank you for lore,12
honestly have to admit they drew it out more than i was expecting,13
i feel people really forget how much of a banger that first game was because of the following two games if only that game had gone g2 s way we d be looking at a much closer series,36
only if they could get like cube and beishang for topside keeping the rest of the team maybe lwx and care could work better knowing that they can rely on other players too,33
tbh going in worlds in a group that was not particularly strong followed by a exit in quarters is pretty bad for an lec 1st seed,29
same game was working fine until last patch,8
wp to this sion he played safe during laning phase minimized deaths and yea he let some cs go but now hes scaled level and is working with his team to win the game well played to this sion,40
will always remember faker riven vs na challenger during season worlds,12
fnatic has to revert back to old logo,8
even a jayce couldnt carry clg,7
the icons look really cute,5
dig sucks whole as a team people are just looking for a scapegoat,13
r confidentlyincorrect,1
negative azir gaming,3
iirc the rumors were that carzzy didn t want to play with rhuckz,12
yeah kassadin should just out range renekton lmao this balancing is shit and thank god we are going away from that with each patch i m waiting for the deletion of tsunderer,31
you re the one that spent hours bashing a game you don t play nor care about on an unrelated subreddit because it s the same genre of your favourite game,28
feel like lulu being at is a mistake it s a pretty simple champion that is also very popular,19
what a mistake of a champion riot is on fucking copium,11
and the yi named,5
he stages games with viewers to show ultra op broken builds,11
amazing transition of dk from being rekt by t1 to becoming the t1 at home in less than a week,20
tldr dogshit idea,3
what are you even doing watching this and spending time commenting in this thread if you don t watch the lcs,20
are ad assassins good atm or why is duskblade so strong,11
i got chromas in total during essence emporium events including all lol partner program exclusive chromas,17
pretty cut and dry,4
not much here but i m interested in seeing more of patch work out,13
yea incels and sexists want to nitpick everything a woman does no surprise,13
that s rough hope he s doing ok thanks for the insight ls,11
xmithie 1st followed by sven both of them has far more accomplishments,12
right so that s why he s only had buff and bug fixes in of the patches between season and,21
i mean jhin can difference is aoe vs no aoe,10
year of the duck,4
yep thats why you see people hit ult first then q to execute,13
this is not your iron elo games where any random with items can 1v9,15
theres a video that there will be no more lot added so probably we get the missions in the first patch,21
urgot supp,2
i got stuck at points i ve earned about challenge since then and none of them have counted using a score tracking site doesn t work for me either it says i have points,35
i thought fly is best in the west and is gonna fist eu and match with lck lpl wasn t that the copium you were all high on,27
also told y all that botlane wasn t the only problem vitality had last split don t fancy scapegoating bo though,18
there s no way vit win this,6
the only thing the kinda bothers me about these championship points is that spring doesnt have more weight to it than winter surely there should be some recency bias,29
yeah let s imagine yagao going against worlds form zeka,9
i rarely see this champ but when i do is the most obnoxious shit ever,15
in her original lore she was still supposed to be a fluid dancer considering the original girl she was build to emulate was a skilled dancer,26
because a balanced bracket as you see it would require a multiple all bronze teams to queue up at the same time most people don t want to sit in a minute queue for clash so brackets aren t perfectly even,41
wtf is perkz doing,4
gt as carry u don t have to think ever typical reddit d1 take lmao,14
that s pretty based but quite surprising good luck to hidon danish league scene strikes again,15
maybe but his last split was pretty rough,8
when lcs would rather censor innocuous words from the english language than accept that people don t like hearing a certain caster,21
ff spammers already work hard towards achieving their goal in life and loose no need to incentivize them further,18
change how his e works you cant push against him and also his e cancels aas,16
i d take them forsure i m a top lane main what role did you climb in,16
he s not hurting for mana late game so might as well chuck on those points but the skill order seems to be correct that q gt w gt e is the play now,29
expected and deserved,3
that upset kid seems rather good maybe fnatic should have a look at him,14
anyone know how tall kobe is u tnomad pls help,10
thieves is not looking to win in the lcs they are looking to win at the bank they aren t a good team but their post match summaries always have the most upvotes and comments on reddit,37
we got nothing to lose anymore might aswell pray to hit high,12
let him aa during his passive,6
the problem is bruisers are mainly buying it for its active which riot says patches thier counterplay in high elo so it won t be that simple,26
yuumi jungle,2
damn i way buying it on every heavy tank support champion in aram,13
all of us kled mains are dying for a new skin please riot there s so much potential and so many amazing community concepts,24
i m sure by making this debut oscarinin screwed his career and has little to no chance of landing a good team next year,23
i dont really mean broadcast i am talking about reddit hopefully this will get picked up on talkshows in the coming week,22
limit played that pretty horribly,5
i just know the team won t shotcall ping just for you but will bait ping you for making a mistake,19
showmaker jayce is pretty spooky when he s on form too,10
jinx is just so turbo bad into aruelion at every point in the game gg,15
target banned gets champ banned in phase one xd,10
yes i own some tsm lmao,6
the xayah nerfs are definitely significant it means that she probably can t just skip an attack speed item and be forced to either go kraken alacrity or pd before navori,30
because there aren t as many people who are negative about her as you think,14
a very cute corpse though you must admit,8
very nice of riot to punish me as sion when im behind my jgl charging q,16
in terms of gameplay skill they are the same in terms of toxicity eu players are the world champs of interesting toxic in game chat,25
league when,3
top lane has its problems but ranged top is not one of them simple as that only ranged top i ll play or play with is kennen rest are an auto dodge,31
zedd gigachad lider,3
orr he locks in twitch and flashes right into the face of the enemy midlaner either way it ll be very entertaining,21
i wonder how uzi could felt if deft did it he could have too,14
so you think clg will beat c9 bold i like it,11
closer i see an opportunity to put down some concrete here let s group up bjerg and dl nono play slow play slow,22
fail lmao you got completely destroyed,7
you blind sion i pick sett,7
it s probably a bunch of embarrassed devs one dev on the team who loves duo queueing with their beau playing yuumi and another tyrannical lead dev who refuses to admit they were wrong source i am an anonymous spy,38
vit vs ast gonna be a banger,7
did dl just cleanse air,5
i love the current form of abyssal mask it has everything i want sustain health mr plus mr shred cdr and it has synergy with sunfire and most tank kits,30
i thought his segment with fudge was good,8
nope i m not a big chatter matter of fact i mute of people i play with bc they distract me,21
cuz this got posted during eu hours,7
simple and common interaction yeah i fly over that pit every second after killing the herald i ve never seen it a single time since they added the hexgates and i m a jungle main,33
relegate both these teams and put wildcard gaming in their place,11
back in the day most players were in silver as all you needed was a pulse to get into silver a lot of those same players are in bronze iron now and struggling to get back into silver,37
the fact that he looked exactly the same player on fpx in the summer and showed no attempts to fix the glaring issues in his game,26
even going second is quite an achievement for our region,10
i m saying if dodging wasn t possible people would stop hostaging,10
on the other hand cuzz s gragas is goat,8
nine nine,2
only crazy fans thought fnc were huge favorites besides that the favorites going into quarters were rng gt kt gt fnc gt ig gt the rest af gt edg gt g2 gt c9 if you ask me,23
gt trynd ult would be op gt zeri gaming laughs in nasus,12
blast cone,2
as long as people use zoe and yone as examples of true damage despite it being post mitigation i am gonna have to mention them,24
nah patrick gt jackspectra and mersa and limit are about equally bad,12
how on earth can you play with a locked cam,10
why did clg have to play a tiebreaker if they were vs 100t,15
how can my rank be so much higher than my mmr when i have a positive winrate,17
as a boomer who played since season i don t get this obsession with old graves he was just lucian at home before the rework new graves is way cooler and more skill expressive,34
jankos in heretics is like rock lee with weights,9
ehh it s the first few rounds bring in flowers for finals and it s fine,14
euw will just insult you in chat while korea and china servers will go afk regularly if they are tilted,20
let s hope not or we will truly miss his kind,10
they are opposite styles impact is all about consistency but when was the last time any of his teams used him as a win condition,25
i doubt they would acknowledge it if i did but we ll see i d be surprised if nobody mentioned it at all,21
and were all won by tl this post is some shit xd,14
how is her presence in lpl lck is she pick or ban there too,16
some champs can be op in solo and worthless in pro yi is one of them not saying he is op but hes never going to be a pro champ,30
because of the decision fnc s management made essentially they let him go,12
i mean 3rd or 4th really doesn t change much tbh both kt and dk are much better than lsb and hle anyway,22
well peanut was the mvp for t1 in the last series they played,14
just got in excited to see th winning immediately they start to lose nice edit nvm,16
afk jungle,2
wait you mean the same phroxzon that is currently on the balance team lol that s cool,16
that dlift play was actually insane there,7
lider be like instalock just to show dominance,9
if it was helpful tho in my experience that this things works at best in times toxic people aware of this thing and just ignore this word and keep typing,31
wait i thought surprise party fiddle was a legendary wth,10
nerf gp passive give everyone gp passive,7
yup you got it haydn s name was inspired by the real composer joseph haydn happy you noticed,17
good point i ve never thought of that,7
or faker who made the pick mainstream,7
not how that works zed doesnt have sustained damage just because his autos scale with attack damage kayle builds full ap and has way better sustained damage your premise is fundamentally flawed,32
both games are hours earlie,6
understandable thorin said as much in the four horseman show but he was just mistaken i used to be faculty at a do medical school so it s a sensitive topic haha,31
yuumi is cute,3
if youtube notices you are using other people s content they won t notify the original creator only tell the content stealer to delete the content there is no way to manually allow it either,33
i really wanted to get the prestige mf skin but with no pass available now im unsure if thats possible any ideas on how or if it is grindable i m at me as is,36
hrmm interesting i almost never apply mathematics in my daily life but i write a lot of emails that has to be very formal and correctly written my girlfriend who is a scientist use both daily also,37
aboslutely kobbed em,3
lck is a one team region again will probably have all their representatives in the ko stages of worlds,20
tsm knows the lcs is only going to get worse getting out early to stop the bleeding,17
in this episode xiaohu went harsh on light,8
wait asol wasn t picked or banned the past game it s been so long i know it s hard to remember,20
jad support is my favourite especially when u finish support item and get a fire cape,16
i agree karma is much more fun and much more broken in wr and they don t even nerf her,19
i prefer the use of pheromones,6
ofc they are mfkers clean their twitter more meticulously than doctors clean the operating room,15
those are amazing i hope you will make one with knight and ruler sometimes,15
no he s not that s my point he s nowhere close,9
yeah definitely not saying t1 is unbeatable but you can t take them out like that so many mistakes left and right from both teams i felt like i was watching lpl for a split second,35
berserker and prince will feast on these adcs jeez man,10
holy crap what a cocky aggression,6
they face fly and whoever wins that bo5 faces c9 for all the marbles,14
phreak and azeal in shambles,5
half the annoying champs that people cry about aren t even the strongest ones,13
only reason why we re winning is because carn is there to say no everytime dardo comes up with an idea,20
you will never hear t1 fans ever apologize for the nonsense they post prior to every tournament they ll just dissapear from threads and appear randomly at worlds to sell stories of their team,33
xayah uses galeforce often because it allows her to instantly reposition for her e and she was perfectly playable in the old xayah kaisa meta with tons of engage when galeforce didnt exist,33
im pretty sure he got a mana growth and an e mana cost buff in the recent past,18
doesn t make sense the parry from fiora hit the malphite which reduces atk speed by for seconds which would be enough time for fiora to flash or q out,31
yes back then it was a lot closer to dota,10
millio plus lucian is absolutely aids right now lucian is balanced around his short range and having millio just chucks all of that out of the window millio is better with lucian or draven than he is with caitlyn,40
i m not gonna deny he was terrible in the tournaments you mentioned but he was easily the mvp that season,20
fakers death should ve sealed the deal kt had more than enough time to double tp into the base and finish it,21
stupidity,1
shout out to bel veth who is technically a completely naked girl yet also an epic monster chanp,16
publish them somewhere so we can see them for ourselves once in a while,14
i m pretty sure the bounty system is random at this point like guaranteed random none of the bounties in any game seem to make sense,25
yall still hyped for vicla,5
i mean a good of gold is filled with people with unlimited time but i agree the question is posed very weirdly should be more like with full dedication to league what rank do you think you could get,40
i couldnt watch game until this morning because my blood pressure was just absolutely through the roof,18
that s how i feel tbh,5
i just wanna point out by the time showmaker got moonstone the game was already over in all three of those games so we never got to see if it was useful at all he build it 3rd 4th,37
when i heard rekkles call his xayah the cooking pick i knew that proplayers have no fucking idea how to use this term,23
bro i saw fudge at worlds,6
pretty sure darius pull was coded in a fucked way up to at least season,16
zeus got camped early game and still ended up being a complete menace,13
yes lec is on and lcs is on lec should be on after the round robin,19
now this is the fnatic i was expecting last week nice,11
extremely safe scales really well and is not terrible early unless you gut her and i mean gut her she ll be there,22
i guess it s what it is that s the nature of the game,12
only on k sante his other champions has been mediocre at best,11
if the adc refuses to fight there s not much i can do 1v2,13
huni trying to be a good hypeman while also trying to not wake up his parents sleeping next door,19
remember how odo fucked oscarinin yesterday he got fucked harder today amp x200b oscarin vs photon won t be pretty,18
yeah that makes much more sense timeline threw me off,11
idk i think you guys are going off for no reason much better to hear the crowd chanting than having it be a library never been to a football match,30
man i feel bad for you,6
ive been playing for years and never noticed any of that lmfao,13
he was also in shanghai for the months of terrible lockdowns that probably factored into his decision,17
yuumi delenda est,3
i m wondering how much practice maple has on asol he s making some strange mistakes,14
bjerg strat found to be obsolete in eu,8
how is rekkles not up for player of the game,10
yea but how it s played is massively different on the teams it isn t for this show for example let s say busio wasn t here and it was tenacity as a guest would this episode have changed at all nope,38
wasn t it on sale during the world cup i think you just missed it,14
because he is the most powerfull mon champ in lore and he is a big space dragon he wasn t supossed to be niche champ like ivern or signed,28
game lost at first herald lol,6
what do you mean by powerball team comps,8
she gets bonus ms on her ult wall,9
idk what happened to evi i enjoyed watching him at worlds in lec he is quite a let down,18
year of the duck is real,6
is goredrinker jayce tech correct here ik it has use cases,11
it should be north of the 60s for dd considering when it s built,13
rageblade ashe is was and always will be the biggest lost to boris ever since the crit chance got set to it removes the bonus damage from passive so you fall off a cliff even harder than before,39
aye there was a legit velkoz angle there woulda shredded sion and poppy and a good matchup into azir,19
mine is on n,4
you ll just have lane swaps every time the position switches maybe you weren t around for the time when that was meta in pro play,24
i feel like they should give the option to refund skins that were changed significantly due to meddling i paid full price for aether wing kayle and pulsefire ezreal but now they are my two most hated skins in the game,41
el contracto at it again,5
perkz was literally better in the bo5 you re referencing,9
it was probably one of his worst plays this season,10
a lot of restaurants don t even check id,8
spica vicla and eyla are unbelievably bad how was fly so dominant early in the season,16
funny enough i can t find an argument good enough to discuss it okay you win this one,17
yeah u imls has to be punished someone has to hold this guy accountable on a bit more formal way,19
zven also playing from home on ping lmao,9
do they really think that s going to dissuade me from banning her of the games even if her winrate is shit hell no,24
i thought nocturne ult was just making it dark and thought wow this is so useless,16
brah fudge just played kennen,5
can someone check 113s pc because for some reason every single button on his f cking keyboard is bound to that goddamn ahri emote,23
if a donkey can fuck a dragon what s wrong with a man fucking a fish,15
sk and ast cooking,4
seems mostly like it s saying it s op,8
so then explain me what ranged top does to a person who faces a considerate amount of them,17
it has to be the most frustrating thing for a pro player,12
yeah agree with this this gives players a greater sense of achievement,12
because when you re being held hostage in champ select everyone is hoping someone else will be the first to flinch so they wait till the last second,27
regi said he rather sell his car and house before becoming like clg now he even sells his own org,21
so the pass is out i m no pro with time zones sadly so i have zero clue,17
hello fnatic do you have any junglers on the bench,10
don t forget that each clg match is a coinflip this is probably the most accurate clg game predictor,19
lmao the heartbreak from that and msi must be haunting dk forever,12
gt having a champ be so fundamentally broken its gotta be the only champ banned from pro isnt a good look for riot but aren t viego banned as i remember at the moment,33
can you share some with the rest of the class,10
yes ladd,2
they should already be happy to have a shot against heretics,11
i mean it s probably more that thought their adc could flash the flash max range malph ult from full vision luger is not having a good day today,29
gt the problem is that mages just need more items in general exactly,12
nah it s because for the longest time his only mention in this sub are his variety streams back when he was permabanned and those content were peak entertainment,28
if we ignore all the parts where he sucked then he didn t suck sure dude you do you,18
has markoon improved i only watched a few of their games but he was looking like he was tilted or something and sort of griefing,25
nahh sheo,2
like how marksmen support became a thing just to counter heimerdinger and other marksmen supports,15
evi fans are hilarious man he is comfortably the worst top in the league,14
that maybe explains the early game but not the way he played teamfights the coordination was completely off,18
definitely easier to play idk if his matchups are easier in higher elos tho,14
it was in the not in so can say he was genius in the is well,19
yeh i agree but maybe kat splash is just too godlike and shadowed the others,15
it must be katarina no her ult alone has such crazy damage scaling and considering that we assume full rotation i would assume that means she gets to fully channel it,31
i can t remember the year but just google blaber scuttle msi and you ll know why lol,16
i thought you cannot kill teammates on sr,8
yep changed my life don t miss those damn stunts they put in,12
gragas has some pretty exploitable flaws in the laning phase if he goes mid,14
gamers can t handle a woman in a tank top laure it s not your fault,14
wow i never even thought about that,7
if you are on a manaless champion i m pretty sure the game doesn t let you take biscuits,17
this game has felt so much like a minute one sided match every game since s12 ended,18
i have never had a situation where two different targets were knocked up but not close together this is honestly very new to me was this how it worked at launch,31
let me just bring up this completely unrelated context,9
gt i swear i wish they made seraphine a complete psycho that acts nice on the outside random schizo ramblings on twitter included,22
we ll see what happens in the groups maybe they ll pick it up and get to another level there maybe they won t it ll be fun to see,26
dude do you know what the end stats would be for a hr game genuinely curious,17
i don t watch it i tuned in once this season and turn that shit off as i was falling asleep and never return i enjoy league and it s annoying for it to be that boring,35
poeple like playing yuumi which is probably the number one goal of any champion that comes out this also means she makes a lot of money yes,27
after watching this game i can certainly say that na will win worlds this year,15
revenge for the man sleep,6
gt is the ranked singed gassed too man i love minish but kuba is undoubtedly better,16
live evil,2
full tank malphite with highest dmg in team and same as corki that s solid rock solid,15
tbf i really doubt that he s getting paid a lot his options were go to tl or not have an lck spot,22
hle was in t1 head ma man because of tht one stinking lost so t1 was proly nervouse in g1 and g2 to decide how to approach,26
50k,1
why are you assuming fnc has a chance to win,10
letigress is absolutely unwatchable wtf no point literally onto nothing the whole game gets everything wrong talks about fuck all but the game that s happening wtf,26
what a terrible time to release this article,8
idk if pros are pros cause they can see those openings but i m surprised hans call that play at with so much confidence,24
true the gameplay showcased by 100t definitely isn t the same gameplay bjerg and doublelift have showcased their entire career clearly the coach needs changing,24
gracias amigo,2
so renekton is not a carry,6
aka my na summoner name,5
wtf it should be the exact opposite if i m gold i should only vs gold s and if i m better you should climb up wtf,26
that was so amazing one minute you re walking up to bot trying to stop backs and just die the next minute you re flash ulting their tank to help set up a kill,33
this meta really doesn t allow jungles to carry they get too little xp from camps even blaber is just on perma sejuani maokai duty now,25
haha yeah i giggled at that though top would still be fair just not almost,17
not a game obviously but one guy carried all of spongebob seasons the leaders definitely matter,17
do baron empowered cannons break the damage reduction,8
i think upset also talks a lot and gives a lot of input regarding shot calling i m sure that helps a lot with a korean and a chinese player,29
lol this comment is so pathetic these players give their all to their work and passion they deserve to be celebrated when their accolades collect up try doing something with your own life before booing,35
hell i play seraphine and never knew this was possible probably a nunu thing and if it isn t then it s a bug,22
he s borderline broken,3
why run presence of mind on rek sai,7
ksante is a neat champ,5
gragas is just kind of the goat of champ design my dude,12
wait didn t an interview with jojo said a lot of his trash talk is stuff vulcan tells him cause vulcan can talk the talk,24
i made the same mistake in the first urf,9
idk why he left mad tbh his fiesta play style suits mad a lot more,15
you lose all your chill the moment you lock in draven,12
edg t1 will eat g2,4
least insane eu player,4
lmao why is it hard for you to believe that a league player was being toxic regardless the last second ff is funny not sure why anyone would get genuinely upset over it,33
yeah the champ is crazy hard to deal with on items it felt like they could ve just sacrificed one or two earlier drags to get him to that point instead of bringing him down to watch the dragons get taken,41
its fine senna got her attack range increasing boytoy in the form of milio,14
you don t have to be productive you know that right mf thinks we live in the soviet union and shit,22
no more thresh for busio please,6
wasn t tank akali before her rework even,7
my grandma with arthritis would play better than this smh,10
that busio rakan flank engage by baron was the nuttiest thing i ve seen from this team all split,18
isn t nilah primarily melee,4
not surprising they literally have erl players,8
i just feel like right now every team in eu minus xl and th can win against everyone and loose to everyone feels great watching lec but i am getting worried for msi as not a single team feels consistent,40
she s a money printer it s literally just an anime cat on a book no effort or thought required,18
i like that hans just walks in to die and let the rest of the team escape what a hero,20
that would be a bad omen comes msi,8
nah ruby looks like a top mid so far in the split,13
yeah in normals i can play ad ahri leblanc botlane and it still isn t really an issue with my team unless i really int my lane,25
i hate it when her icon goes back to default when you respawn,14
idk how him and hans are the only ones playing him in the west,14
your illaoi hate fuels me jokes aside she really is a champ people like everything outside of her gameplay huh her kit just ruins peoples perception of her,28
who knows maybe combined with summer they can go,10
i said he looked like a 90s action movie villain yesterday today he s an 80s erotic mystery thriller i wonder what he is tomorrow but i know it ll be 70s based,31
need to see razork do something with this lead,9
fog of war is the only thing that can protect other teams from beating t1 at this point,18
hats off to you guys and sk no other teams have such an entertaining online presence,16
bb lt photon yike gt bo caps gt perkz hans upset mikyx gt kaiser,15
people that frequent lsf are usually pretty cringe so not surprising,11
this is why it s such a disappointment to me when they release a new support especially this newest one that is literally just a mashup of other kits god please just focus on the champs that actually need it,39
bo it s good that you ganked top but the point of caitlyn is to gank bot and rush tower plates,20
given that ranged bullies aren t played in pro bar gp it s clear that they re sub optimal picks surely quinn top tristana top etc should be everywhere with how blatantly op people believe adcs to be,35
going for that anti record too bad it can t be,13
she is so so bad,5
gt tell what a ton of boosting like it s not even funny how much blatant boosting is around diamond,19
did they release something saying when they think it will be back,12
absolutely i guess i m not the only one who thinks that the old auto attack was priceless,17
in all fairness emenes spent more time around clg champions than c9 pretty sure he thought was clg,18
yup i think they deleted the rumble guide because i can t seem to find it but his leaguecraft series is still up on his channel,26
keeping the opposing role down is part of your own role since you lane against them that s how it works emenes kept trist down,24
fnatic best team in eu they beat heretics yesterday so fnatic gt heretics gt mad lions gt astralis gt g2 gt vitality,12
no there ll be no difference you gain a ton of blue essence on a new account doesn t really make a difference,21
this happens to every champion that becomes an issue in proplay not just midlaners stop being a victim,18
nah crumbzz also said some wack ass shit considering he used to a pro,14
razock vs malrang in the fnatic game,7
yeah worlds meta was different and geng was visibly comfortable in the meta compared to when they were in lck,20
actually i ll be the one going lul here since actually you re the one who hasnt been watching lma0,18
bork doesn t beat tanks what are you fucking saying,9
yeah the year dl and bjerg played together for the last time,12
bad coaching worked to death burn out mental boom take your pick,12
maybe cause it s harder to get banned i got like warnings before i got permed just kept extending my chat restriction,22
my original statement is correct i am sorry your literacy levels have not advanced for many years,17
they probably only lose doran but peanut has flash w ward jump amp zhonya which he used to chase ezreal to likely get out it s also their second elder buff which is double the duration,34
xayah being the best adc of the patch and one of the signature rekkles picks gets me high on that hopium,21
i ve found that sometimes if ur in the bottom you can t purchase items at first either,16
i love my iron mates using zed supp tho,9
larsen dies to patrik there if malrang didn t body block for larsen,13
what happened to the mad lions that play vs koi i swear they are different people,16
i think both can be true at the same time,10
they were flaming hard too and now he is 2nd in lec lol,14
imagine if bro built ludens shadowflame,6
the zoom in on the empty chairs will never not send me,12
thats the point im not famous but as long as hextech lab made the same video even if i did first or better i will still be a copy,29
goddamn i can t believe it s been years since this video came out,13
freejankos,1
i couldn t watch did he actually say that,8
stop screeching it doesnt make the game more exciting,9
good one out of all things that i ve never implied this one takes the cake i m actually happy for any small free bonus i get,25
very intelligent itemisation too completely shuts down any topside play vitality could hope to go for,16
good old broadcast narrative spinning,6
that s still damn patronizing if they assume that since you re doing well you actually have to be a man but i guess it doesn t bother you because it s true,29
morg doesn t win lane as hard as lux which makes it harder to do the lane s wincon of pulling out a big bot lane lead and applying that pressure around the map,32
not inherently who knows what riots implementation of it is actually doing,12
might be an hour earlier i m not sure i think there was a time change recntly march 12th in us and that sometimes also change the time new content is released,31
well he s dead so i doubt he would make it any farther than rhat,14
he was good to great in as many games as any other mid this split which is impressive when he had half the games as most of them,28
i know that just don t appreciate it so my bad,10
ah fuck thank the gods i relied on s alot,10
i mean this also means there is a chance for xl to make msi yes,15
otp urgot top lane usually ban olaf unless i m last pick,10
ahh graves adc good times bloodthirster gt phantom dancer done auto q anytime someone tried to trade good times good times,21
now watch everybody bust their backs to get lvl on sett just so they can have the boss title but honestly i support your proposition we really need more female oriented titles and this is a perfect opportunity,38
i think him and blaber are close wouldnt say hes by far the best but hes up there for sure,20
idc if dig lost tomo is doing a great job and dig is looking wayy more competitive,17
ashe heimer is pretty strong and they were stomping the 2v2 ashe was not an issue at all if gnar doesn t randomly get a cs lead,27
please just give us the champion shard i don t want them auto added to the collection i purposely don t have certain champions so i can reroll the skin shard for them because i never want to play them,38
cleanse the summoner spell additionally cleanses summoner spell debuffs namely ignite and exhaust while other cleanse effects are only for forms of cc,23
it s seems you re a bit behind on the meta red gwen isn t really played anymore meta is really diverse though plenty of playable decks,24
c9 100t who come from losers bracket probably after losing to c9 in winners finals after beating fly,18
then yeah he s trolling,4
adc player feeling of what top players feel every patch,11
sunfire evelynn microwave,4
i feel sorry for tt fans who had to watch that game,13
sanest lcs enjoyer,3
riot punish nobody because flex exist,6
fearless draft when,3
they re related it runs in the family i guess,9
plenty of champions are like this,6
mikaels gives more magic resistance than spirit visage,8
not stressful at all,4
rengar top time,3
better record between the three of them if you tally up the win loss record between the three teams this is what you get 1st clg 2nd eg 3rd 100t,32
jax has no skillshots and his rotation is very simply you prep e then jump and wack,17
wp to this sion he played safe during laning phase minimized deaths and yea he let some cs go but now hes scaled and is working with his team to win the game well played to this sion,38
well when i first started playing dota after playing league for a long time i felt like dota is much more complex too,23
5th in power rankings,4
agreed with op any more pictures of the design,9
thank you lt,3
bugi check your paypal,4
also forgot to add the production quality is never good with the lower leagues if they somehow got a increase in budget it could be pretty interesting to watch hopefully that increases overtime though,34
its significantly worse this split probably because the start time is awful,12
wants to role play as cute fluffly critter picks teemo role plays as a war criminal instead,15
if ast had decent or really any marco at all this game would be over,15
the fun thing too is everyone else is talking about abilities literally no other comment about the rng damage reduction passive,21
it s my first time playing new jg and i thought the primal smite is supposed to do dmg and unleashed was supposed to do not sure if i m confused or if it s bugged,35
not like thats different for any other champ though if you use up all your cc before katarina jumps in she will also melt your entire team hell even samira will and shes an adc,35
yea that was a super obvious bait bud,9
i mean they have coaches who never played the game once in the nfl it s curious how they can know the limits and what one should be able to do when they have never been in that situation,38
his q was bullets that did extra damage if more than one hit,14
samira buffs woo i assumed this would happen since the passive was almost worthless before level still a nerf compared to her pre nerded passive but i think she ll be in a pretty balanced state now,36
bo perkz and upset really gonna finish this week deathless ain t em edit damn i jinxed him lmao,18
he s been living in korea since like 2015ish i believe but he didn t really pop off into the like light until like 2018ish so it isn t the fact he lives in korea otherwise he would of popped off much sooner,40
you played today after not playing for weeks you and i both know it s true but yeah sure act surprised,21
still not wrong if this were an erl or academy player this wouldn t get even a quarter of the attention but since it s t1 and faker it s all of a sudden regarded and heralded as peak league of legends,39
as the biggest blabeliever on the planet i m extremely biased but i genuinely believe that if he had started his career in lpl or lck and been playing there this whole time he would have won worlds by now,39
i would prefer if he cost be,8
i only have yuumi lock i guess it s over now,10
har dee har,3
someone edit this so instead of him hitting masters it goes to a banned screen,15
i mean that wouldn t surprise me either lol,8
simple clean straight forward i like it looks like e has two charges,12
oh didn t know double promotions were a thing thank you,10
but pyosik beat t1 without smite surely he can beat lcs teams,13
the twitch i have on my team in every single aram when he ults,14
lol just had a game where someone tried to go sett adc and my friend counterpicked with urgot i was asol jungle we won,24
this is some of the new art from legends of runeterra featuring zilean holy shit that is how you do a rework,22
yeah group a looks harder for ast than group b for bds,12
game of the split imo vicla was fun af to watch,11
strg shift y z depends on your language settings in replay mode unlocks the camera zoom took me up until early s12 to learn that this exists,24
bronze players will finally be able to identify to a team at msi,13
you must be new to lck nothing special here tbh this happens literally every game this is why i mute the lck broadcasts lmao don t let anyone here tell you otherwise they re all t1 fans that s why,37
the game gives you same runes as op gg and u gg most popular,14
tbh you should still cancel the auto with movement command between every auto you just have to time it right the automatic follow isn t nearly as fast as properly done cancel,31
in a world where windwall hard ranged cc passive shield high move speed and infinite dashes exists,17
kingen is zeus s daddy holy shit,6
wait what what s the point of the toolbar then,9
dignitas letting us down one last time,7
it should surprise no one if any league website by riot is shit the client is also built and i use the word built lightly upon web technologies,28
lmaoo you re right,3
the fact it s called crime city now is a big sticking point though,13
think of him more as burst utility than dps people pick him because he can be safe and workable i think he s only good rn if you have another way to deal with tanks or have dps somewhere else in your comp,41
imagine egoing into a bad matchup and getting pounded by the worst performing mid in the league,17
man vitality fans eating some mad crow after talking talking shit this whole week lol,15
by just playing on his other acc he would ve hit masters as well difference is he try harded on his old otp and didn t fuck around,26
eg did too,4
but wunder is out s,5
that was fucking gorgeous from observers wow,7
gt waste of oxygen humans pretty toxic of yourself to say this no,13
penta tho,2
boo urns clg ez,5
elise got saved by larssens ult lol,7
pretty sure k1ng is on the academy roster,8
jeonghoon chest bump too manly to handle by vit,9
they did but they massively buffed w auto damage so you re incentivised to build nashors and max w because q max in lane for constant poke sucks now,28
maybe including this patch though with msi usually occuring in may i wouldn t be surprised if was the patch,20
the goal was to move her from upper tier play to lower tier play she is less upper tier play bound from what we can see just not enough maybe,30
kim for me was always in the top player no matter what,13
there has been almost no point at which vayne hasn t built bork unless bork is trash shes been that way since season,23
i mean would you rather that danny was forced to play with his mental health issue if anything this solidifies that was the right decision,25
oof i hope this is just a bad start for a hopefully well developing scene,15
thats because alot of people value their ego higher than their winrate,12
there could be a thread saying riot is giving everyone rp and someone would still complain that it s only i just ignore it to be honest it s not worth thinking about,33
good make her about winrate for everyone,8
she was catfished,3
oh i meant in lec i ve seen highlights of the t1 game though,13
praying for sejuani ult to hit,6
it doesn t cleanse himself and that matters his first or second item every game has to be blessing,18
looking forward to see how upset does hoping for good things,11
he got better because the jungle got more gold so because he farms he got better,16
just wait till yuumi is enabled you will enjoy her be perma pick or ban,15
i mean yes i know what your point is but those games were still closer than these two today,19
he is strong but master is never a good sample size k games is not enough sample size in d he has a wr so yeah master he is probably even stronger,34
unranked accounts can duo with any rank for their first game so they duo with a fresh account each game and undeservedly get masters by having gold plat lobbies,28
if you re gonna diss ggmf then also count the actual worst ultimate skin aka k da seraphine in,19
lck lpl is trash now,5
search umbral glaive results found i ain t reading all of that,12
i ve seen enough people dodge regular arams to know where this is going,13
the one that yorick had,5
prob the w so he can t just fly off,9
this game was looking so one sided and then fq was like is that all you got,17
failed reworked time to remove yuumi,6
but unnironically gragas was his best pick the only champion helping him to avoid a lot of unnecessary deaths,19
kinda but kinda not,4
imagine telling people months ago that was gonna outjungle bo i mean props to astralis but bo is legit running it every game lmfao,26
man i missed papasmithy and spawn s casting,7
are you taking about pronouns s,6
legit where are these people getting off saying armut was good,11
this roster won t work guys upset take too many resources,10
got maple some boomer help at last,7
this exact list except for sona she s hard to play good and heavily team dependant early for a super reliable support for a beginner i would suggest something like lulu,30
explain to me how you have a 2k gold lead in the midgame and you get exactly turrets fucking embarrassing,21
vayne dies if a q hits post,8
i literally never said anything else lol,7
r unexpectedcommunity from drakos,3
getting level as support even in soloq almost never happens,11
bard players just think about the game in a completely different way,12
find new boyfriend,3
wth does has way too many blue lines in the pursuit of his own body even mean lmao i don t mind letigress but some of the stuff she says reminds me of riv,33
it s possible she meant that literally no one talks but i took it as there are windows of no one talking,21
so you don t know then you re using something in a rant where you have no clue whether it s even true,19
if his e actually did shit to minions he would be a broken solo laner,15
somewhere somehow a you can hear a the thousand cries of e duos,12
new mobile update looks good but should definitely bring back an op gg link in there i personally don t miss the twitch link,22
i find dravens juggling mechanics to be tiresome i wonder if a lot of pros just hate that too,19
it s a single series won t matter much in the scope of things,12
is low if is center to center is actually very low he is melee,16
i really hope tes can make it far but i remain unconvinced after this series some of those decisions were baffling also we need to work on our baron control,30
deft kept getting caught out shame too cuz he was smashing the lane phase so hard,16
can anyone share wpk packer link please,7
so if flyquest lose today winsome back in,9
you used to be able to smite while taking a hexgate too but that was too cheesy so they removed it curious if they keep this interaction in,28
turn chat off you dont need it anymore with all the pings,12
the asol nerfs are huge am i trippin,8
i assume this is a free upgrade for pc players am at work and can t watch how does it look i ve been wanting to reply it there a release date,30
if by outplay you mean the lilia flashing into your ult and missing q on stationary target yes it is outplay,21
thank you when will the next one come out,9
it s more of t1 having grudge and annoyance flashbacks of past matchups against eachother t1 didn t look usual t1 today,20
everyone flashing off cooldown lmao,5
guma is a cho gath one trick like the guy has been playing it as top whenever and like keria just wants to cook and play it bot,28
olaf strong,2
something is real going on,9
maple actually plays very well and selfless most of the time,11
so lazy to not ward there,6
god don t do that to me i m so old,9
incoming asol permaban,3
simple is not the same as easy just because the draven onetricks are good at him doesn t mean he s easy to play in general,24
aint no way mad was a top team in eu last split aint no fcking way,18
fr i m gonna miss that lt you are here pasta after every game at this point i wasn t just hoping jankos could get a win but also just rooting for fnatic to lose lmao,34
i don t pity kenvi wish i got paid to grief on stage,12
arcane diff,2
aw the hug and smiles,5
i think riot games ban them in waves so the people who made those bots can t try to find ways to evade riot games techniques of finding them,28
surprised not more people are talking about the fact you can now counter jungle again and punish enemy jugglers for poor ganks or for over ganking,26
winsome at least had solid synergy with prince,8
pantheon getting possessed is also canon,6
so we agree that ls is telling this story just for attention otherwise what is the purpose,17
congrats to dk for accepting my previous match teammates into their roster jesus christ how many shit teamfights did they go into literally solo queue vibes xd,27
sure link me a single one where they claim that climbing has nothing to do with skill,17
is this relative to last year or to the greatest team eu s ever pumped out,15
his passive literally gives him attack speed if youre not using it thats a huge part of your power budget and dps going to waste,25
as if any other lcs team wouldn t also get reamed by other regions,13
i m very glad to hear this he was my main at one point thank you for the feedback cause i ve seen a lot of people say it s just league like it s always been which is usually a bad thing lmao,40
coming from the hoodie organization that s a big deal,9
wow brilliant analysis,3
the original flash with a unit radius,8
yeah he s probably something just as dumb like a libertarian,10
finally someone with enough sense to allow dark mode to be the default,13
right but it doesn t seem right that i m hardstuck with a positive wr bc my mmr is negative,18
players don t want to try out new champs for whatever reason that s one of the reasons players like doinb or even caps who actually bring out new shit every once in a while are great,35
it s also good on ahri into tanks a liandries cosmic build is already good on ahri rn and this change makes it even better probably would be ok on syndra too,32
trust the process,3
sweating who was the c9 mvp this series button vicla button eyla,14
holy fuck what a game,5
im assuming the universe is trying to work hard against whatever atlus manifested in that draft tweet that didnt went live,21
dk dont deserve to win that if thats how theyre going to teamfight and its worrying that dk struggles so much by playing from behind oml lets just hope they can bounce back from this,35
jarvan untouched malphite untouched jinx untouched xayah untouched but they nerf lee sin it s a joke for prima aprilis guys,20
imt weren t really flanks it was just vi ult followed up by every other players key cooldowns they dog piled on him which is why they lost the fights after,30
you almost made it through the day without exposing yourself like an idiot but like the challenger you exploded,19
so he s basically immortan joe from mad max,8
ls is genuine friends with like people the rest are just for content,14
finally a fight with rekkles and surprise surprise he can carry hope his team will not engage without him again,20
dude chime is so wholesome very easy to root for him,11
but kanavi got greed on blue and die lead to ruler penta,12
how did ruby get caught so many times as leblanc,10
it s nice seeing such an historic org having success again wish all the best for you and your nice team,20
i think i can vet the smurfs but i might be in for a nasty surprise lets see,18
they must have some sort of curse no bro it s not a curse it s cuz they re chokers serial chokers at that international titles thrown won t be surprised by a 4th,31
homie said selfmade i would be suprised if bro speaks even one letter chinese,14
yeah he plays 20x more than the average player but he is just really good too i don t think most people would be able to hit challenger in only 100ish games even if they did play as much as him,40
it looked super shaky at the start of winter tbh but it has been steadily improving,16
yes it has to be a ranked game in order to show up in porofessor leagueofgraphs records,16
top laners make the best guests they re spectating most of their own games for practice already lol dhokla is too funny,21
yeah it s insanely easy to dodge her q if you stay behind minions properly i m surprised people are saying it s harder to dodge now i have to assume they just haven t learned to play against it yet,37
he can only carry if his team is already doing well,11
yes its supposed to be but this one says its multiplied by,12
people keep telling me xerxe is actually good but i dont see it,13
actually i doubt anyone would say that for this this is only visible to kennen not the opponent s so there s actually skill expression they re removing compared to gp barrels which shows the enemy,34
oscar s revenge arc will start the moment he leaves fnc though he has to wait since the fnc revenge queue is long,22
advienne vs blitz round,5
tbh not much changed with sg i don t use it though since its animations aren t as smooth as sb that said the biggest improvement on sg was the updated facial feature which looks quite nice which fixes the skin,39
welp i guess next patch its time to reroll all the lolesports watch reward emotes,15
for most champs its slower,5
he had better teammates covering his flaws last year go watch most of tl s losses last year he wasn t proactive in most of their games,25
my bad i misunderstood your comment i agree,9
no he is years old actually,7
nah you can never have too much lemonnod,8
fourth if we include emenes tristana,6
comments like this will never not be hilariously ironic when coming from t1 fans,14
are you ofc when i m talking about an example i ll point out that example,15
yes this split snif,4
no they just want her to return there,8
i can only beat the bots in aoe2 and on lowest difficulty xd i ll get there someday sadly all my friends bar one are noticeably worse players which makes pvp against them unfun,34
this would lead to so so many bot lanes getting tilted at each other as one of them died reading what the heimerdinger velkoz brand lux xerath whatever did thinking they were safely far away,30
i m the same way with nilah she feels like a over tuned dota melee carry soon as you hit lvl and i love it,25
haha and that right there is why they are buffing her early game to give her prio you literally just said i m not gonna play the game out if i have a vayne bot because it s unwinnable,37
weird for sure i wouldn t do this especially not if you rush ibg the extra sheen proc can make a huge difference in addition to the obvious ms buff debuff,29
and how many of these people are supporting bro actively aside from spamming gigachad in twitch and youtube chat and reddit comments,22
wrong winning worlds is the greatest honor in league to do it as a mediocre by korean jg standards player who was a kindred otp just years back is one of the biggest flexes of all time,38
ggs must ve been watching the lck this morning big trust letting gori play the tank let s see if licorice can have his redemption arc,24
she s probably not going to get much flame because people will spin it as trying to tear down a woman in esports,22
league will never have a vc the people who spam the n word in chat wouldn t be able to deal with someone hearing their voice crack,26
clg has to commit on vi ulti once she uses that cooldown she s does very little in a team fight it has to hit a high priority target and they have to kill it,34
what its been better lol its been so much easier to climb wym,13
dude i came here expecting more people talking about it you re the only one i ve seen,16
the items are very strong but you played it about as perfectly as you could have too the empowered w was clutch and using the bushes to your advantage wp,30
the issue is that if people disable it then it s useless disabling it should disable your mic but you should still have to hear it at least in ranked,29
so tired of these posts tbh,6
as per usual the billion dollar company is working their hardest given their budget was unfortunately vacuumed up by tencent once again,22
sucks for him already was wondering why he was playing a little worse,13
tl don t always click but when they do,8
ezreal is twinkish but still with a pretty cocky attitude and doesn t cute fit the cute guy aesthetic i think they mean more of a cutesy vibe in general both personality and look wise like maybe neeko or lillia,39
as someone with a new account in a region i moved to holy shit thank you cannot understate what a big deal this is for a game that s already f2p,30
this series isn t about sion jinx it s spica vs closer really,10
hi yes mejais please,4
looking really strong in the first half of the season and then crumbling away for seemingly no reason is the flyquest way,22
in korea summit is oftentimes pronounced al far ee,7
never heard of that do you have a source,9
no what you just take the bag and fuck off to erl a split later everybody will realize the roster is fucked anyway,24
shut the fuck up with your month old account this is why you made a new account to shittalk people who are already down,25
yea it was norms and good point i think im just too scared of getting flamed but idk its probably just something ill have to push past if i wanna play the game as a whole lmao,37
hmm weibo might have a tough road ahead tt blg rng all beat them during the regular season,18
bjerg could not possibly miss more charms right,8
delete rito pls,3
proper eu fiesta my region,5
team diff across the board 100t did everything to get dl ahead but even in that game he did half of prince s damage embarrassing if 100t gets d by gg will there be a new meme,38
i thought leveling up abilities was how many times you could use them,14
shirley crescent isn t coaching next split right there s no way right,11
fkin dumb shit,3
even if some of the games are snooze the casters are the best so its still enjoyable,17
mordekaiser,1
bailout puts you at and asol e was executing for more than that,14
next game will be different copium,6
league of baby sitting and consoling crybabies for the win,10
lehends does it every game and he s like on blitz so it s viable not sure if anyone else does it tho,22
if it s tl doing it i m all for it,9
when was the last time damwon beat geng in a series,11
wukong was literally torn limb from limb it s too much even though he s not even strong in top right now he is unplayable at top,25
great thing that s not what i said but actually on that topic that is quite literally just a numbers issue,20
are you a bit slow,5
lets not pretend like every org in eu isnt the same rge koi mad fnc vit every org in eu will hostage their top players this is something riot need to fix,31
it s such a draft gap i just don t see what they were hoping to achieve with this,17
i love chaebols she is cute and gave money to esports and starcraft so of course i support that chaebols have created a very large increase in the standard of living in south korea they were very poor after the wars,41
do i need a tinkerer s workshop as well,8
they don t watch basketball lol,5
i mean games where i have more dmg output than the adc that should be a worry then i try and play aggressive then shit the bed,27
kraken gt bt gt anathema vs heavy dive comp,9
they likely have the longest average game time,8
bot so op btw,4
no t1 had rakan since kt s gold lead was all largely on the jayce they just need rakan to lock him down and its an easy gragas ult for the shutdown,31
yea that game was probably the worst vast she s ever had lol but outside of that it wasn t bad,19
maybe she s just fine mid but she s busted top though her being bruiser ish isn t really a problem,17
theb how is it my fault that they gave me that much xd,13
yea and turtle is playing so well rn too,9
bro ask yourself why riot would lie about that they sell skins to make money they re not going to make the less popular skin s and make less money,28
sylas should be safe from killmonger he doesn t fit as a energy card,14
jinx was fine too bad he had wards as teammates,11
nacl,1
church of chovy,3
pyosik was crying tears of joy after looking at his salary steve was willing to pay,16
i just don t understand why team just let the enemy take free inhibs and get the engage on their terms like that makes no sense what so ever,28
should ve been tsm imo that team way overperformed,8
champs iconic outside of a mini rework like a smaller version of ahri the amount of backlash that rework would get would probably not be worth plus there are way too many champs that need it more,37
daylight robbery the sequel,4
that hasn t been the case for a while now but keep spewing bullshit,13
because hle played like fucking insane beasts despite the gold diff,11
yeah i have the same problem,6
huhi azir gt faker leblanc,5
god bless losers bracket,4
well i mean he did go yesterday hard to ignore that,12
just watch finals mad vs rogue if you say it is easy to look clutch in a winning team he s shit now but he was making clutch play after clutch play in the finals,34
did jojo just die to the baron,7
it is i was surprised as well since the prepatch notes had the amped ult nerfs removed but they readded them it seems,23
every time a mid has been crowned best in lcs they immediately started running it down jojo gori maple now emenes,21
link your opgg then,4
fair enough lol same here,5
sucked ofc for the man but the change was completely justified by excel,13
letigress cast worlds finals very good caster,7
overstatted other classes have ample amounts of multiple stats on each item but mages are the ones overstatted,18
because he is shit coach and i guess people started to forget that during his climb and focused on his rank too much he is still bad coach who does not know too much about the game,37
well that was goddamn adorable,5
give jankos a fucking team,5
hopefully this means the end of mythics so awful to be constantly locked into the same items,17
i want evis job security,5
you know the point you conveniently ignored the post that explains it,12
pala got hard smashed in their series by jojo,9
stop putting maple on galio,5
i can agree she s pretty mid but flowers teaching her to cast is peak content they play off each other exceptionally well,22
na modcheck,3
yeah they should buff azir but are hard cucked by the existence of pro play existence of pro play objectively ruins the game for normal people,25
at this point watching fnatic is a fun experience of seeing how an average gold elo team with maybe one smurf fares against actual pro players,26
he had a good r,5
how is this different than sr xd,7
there s a chance ablazeolive actually lost his job,8
dude is so far down the barrel in terms of eu supports i d sooner hit up vander lmao,18
no shit but the comments you replied to were talking about aram so the hide behind minions method doesn t work,20
i basicly got drop in hours of stream recently,11
ah the classic suicide of our favorite duo,8
medic s jokes are bad alright but still nowhere close to fnc s level,12
even great coaches can t do anything if the tools they are working with are useless,15
if you think you re dying here anyway and can t reach syndra then you might as well ult for the stats hp and hope it turns the 1v1,26
doesn t mean we have to love the import players who come for a paycheck,14
actually you re the one who should look at yourself here lma0 asol still outroams annie when he puts a point in w annie needs to keep him in lane early,30
hush i forgot to correct it,6
or he s the only person on his team to have a good map awareness dying alone at your tower vs most of enemy team is not necessarily on him,29
bds peak macro,3
heretics are such a confusing team,6
contrary to g2 rng also has no money,8
meanwhile i just watched dash casting a aoe2 tournament and he killed it,13
damn t1 really wanted to go get steaks to celebrate fakers 10th anniversary,13
blame doesn t matter results do you re not going to get results by swapping out your roster mid season,18
it s because it s impossible to hit the q against good players but if your bad and get hit then it s broken the champ is designed as if players are good and self aware but majority of riots players are bad,40
only thing that he can be held accountable is not being with the team on baron,16
very interesting that viper didn t even make third all pro from the korean community,14
he looked like that the same last year too and ended up winning worlds by massively stepping up it s like he has a switch he flips on and off willingly,30
it s also just a recession and esports orgs are barely if at all profitable and usually they very much arent,20
laying off people doesn t mean you re not also hiring this doesn t really track could just be shifting around departments making some roles redundant this is normal corporate stuff,28
i come back to this video from time to time still fucking gold,13
omg thank you so much,7
deeply upsetting phrase to read,5
poor rekkles it s not like fnatic saved him from another year in erls when he shit on fnatic and went back on his word poor thing he deserves better,29
this is on the same level as caedrel malzahar ult cancel change my mind,14
i would build ie as a second crit item up until like years ago ive been playing the game since and have been an adc main during that time too,32
caps gets the jayce pass,5
great to see that lcs got good enough to not get shit on by the same tsm style anymore,21
that scream is insane,4
he is the only quality player on his team he hard carry s them,13
ask geng and edg how they lost then t1 was favorite but drx was genuinely the second best team at world that year overall not even close but at world they were actually good with that meta and player form,40
busio is trolling,3
quater was more than possible deep runs unlikely but still possible small teams have changed a lot during worlds edg last year for example don t want to go into that really though,33
lmfao sure they would,4
still a great way to showcase what you can do,10
i wont mind one counter argument it is always better to responde to someone instead of downvoting him,18
hes the best top in eu by a pretty wide margin but would not play in lck lpl and is not import level for the lcs,25
never thought i d see the day when tsm would collapse before gg or dig or imt here we are,19
dont want to overreact but g2 fighting with fnc for 9th place,12
hyli is just too good on those engage champions meta shifting back in his favour is huge for mad,19
memes aside the budget was lol pc only,8
she also went from early game to scaler her lv used to pop you now it tickles,18
fuck back to youtube,4
nah he s definitely gonna terrorize pro play the only question is which team gets terrorized,15
thank you for opening this thread loving the lec this year,11
smurfed,1
low gm maybe idk he was mostly trolling in low diamond this year,13
ignore them only boxes are your friends if you don t want to play with teammates play ap then you can ignore people and play your own mini game,28
you face 4th place over 3rd place ggs over eg currently,11
i remember weekly complaining in the threads for the games she casted i always thought she was an alright caster that had a really rough worlds game,27
you got hit by a nidalee spear in the future try not doing that,14
french domination we are doomed,5
your champ shits on him lmao,6
triumph over hp doesn t mean anything most of the times,11
thank god for that one,5
who pissed in your apple jacks,6
ryze gets reworked,3
even if they put in voice chat half your team isn t going to use it i m willing to bet the majority of the community wouldn t i personally wouldn t,28
i m amazed with the amount of people that don t know bitconnect i feel like that meme was spammed to death for like a year straight during the bitcoin boom,29
renegades vs dignitas you know the one,7
that was pretty clean game from tsm,7
dang i was hoping we d actually be seeing them play more engage aside from the odd nautilus by this patch rip,21
on opgg the worst runepages winrate wise always were the bloodline ones if you ever played a champ where you just had bloodline as lifesteal you can recognize that the actual lifesteal is bad af,34
congrats man keep up the upward trajectory and i definitely can see you ending up on tls lcs roster,19
i remember duo ing graves leona we f cked shit up hard that was such an op combo,15
i had an game loss streak last month happens just continue playing,13
tsm sold out and now are desperately trying to salvage it with boomers,13
godlike game by humanoid btw he looks fucking furious on the player cams so its not surprising at all,18
the mental in plat is fucking horrendous i ve noticed there s more players that will int afk if they die once don t get ganked etc etc,24
jinx gonna be eating even better after this patch,9
you chose to make a personal attack rather than an argument at an almost two month old comment that s what s actually disgusting here,23
his evolved w used to apply his passive i still can t understand why the ever loving hell it did that lmao,20
what are you on about adc has been broken since item rework forever really with exception of patches but w e seek help,23
we ve done more than a few playtests trying her out in off roles here and there to see how it does so don t worry we are looking at it,29
wholesome versatile adcs,3
points to flair i m used to it,7
next is zionspartan,3
from the hope of na to giga gapped in a third place match rip jojo,15
this feels like an lpl game,6
how lma0 actually they didn t you re telling me imt threw their game lma0,13
watching her chunk the tank for of their hp or do the classic miss everything and win was certainly a time,22
damage threshold honestly sounds like a great idea imo not so little it instant pops it but so you cant just sort of willy nilly w in without thinking much,30
lider is a psycho lmfao i was a hater previously but wowza i was wrong as fuck,17
anivia is one of the strongest soloq mages right now with a winrate this patch she doesn t need buffs at all she needs nerfs you re smoking some strong shit thinking she needs some love,35
i think i agree with you but in terms of sound effects it s freljord gt gt project,16
can we get rid of those tweets covering up the scoreboard literally adds nothing,14
no shaving man bringing some hockey rituals,7
yeah idk i started playing months ago and almost always just say no apparently if you ever open yourself up to any social interaction you should accept these sort of statements amazing community both in game and on here,40
korean tops,2
the whole bit about immersion honoring got me in stitches man fantastic work as always,15
i did edited the post so it s even more clear,10
strongly agree solo queue is an absolute shit design for mobas there should have never been competitive solo queue just team queue,22
no it s not defending it would be implying that the client isn t shit we all know it s shit some people are just trying to point out how players can deal with it because obviously the players can t just fix the client,41
because eu tops outside of like wunder and maybe alphari are the only ones who are anywhere close to elite,20
as respectfully as possible they need to get the cast under control,12
yeah which is extra ap blasting wand codex will feel a lot better than blasting wand recurve,19
not to shit on a competitor being confident but in hindsight it is hilarious the shit he was saying on yamato s stream,22
let s be real this damwon roster would be first in lec,11
bro u can t say the i word its offensive,9
i d agree with you if the whole team were rookies but the main problem is that the players who were chosen to be guiding influences don t seem to be,29
the worst part is that this seems like both teams are just running around absolutely aimlessly do they have actually some macro gameplan,23
actually youd win if you played better and probably didnt tilt yourself for no reason by looking up people,19
tall ladies hmu,3
rekkles galeforcing into enemy players was a certified hyli moment,11
stop tilting and start using your brains and hands pls,10
i cannot stand lec casting it s the cheesiest shit ever lcs has way better casters they just lost half of them this year,23
makes me long for mad where even 10k gold behind they still could put up a fight at least in regional games,23
oh the dragon comes back to life,7
na skill vampires got to them,6
i believe they re vs c9 fly this split and the majority of those games weren t close,16
gt its just the typical t1 overrating like they re an unstopable force this even happened at msi last year when t1 had their undefeated split,24
leblanc,1
the fact that he can play normally but instead chooses to actively play a tilting playstyle just annoys me even more,21
they didn t poke either,4
hollyy that was gorgeous,4
that is statistically impossible i hope you know this,9
just shows my toxicity level xd,6
agree with that i just started last week and when i tried warwick i just constantly chased after the smell and basically ignored everything else,25
just go watch salty teemo on twitch,7
i love impacts mental,4
she brought in a segment that double lift and reginald tsm owner were in a work dispute lawsuit to bring hype about an upcoming match between tsm and double lift new team nobody liked that,35
how did they manage to lose game with such an early lead,13
he s not going to get better he s been like this for years at this point he plays strongside carry champs and doesn t carry,23
went from different teams that might have been fun to send to msi to one team and hope for the best crazy how bad fly look after the first few weeks,32
what a massacre,3
understandably lot less to fuck up on ap malph,9
look at dota esports for instance most of the pro players from leave the competitive scene stay in the high elo is not easy,26
design philosophies can t change it s not even mostly the same people working on the game since it came out,19
remember when the ie buffs were supposed to break them somehow,11
not putting exakick next to hans and comp is criminal,10
t1 vs drx but they re handcuffed and have to play with their feet,13
same as a c9 fan who hates tsm you describe exactly how i feel,14
nah it s wolf not chronicler,5
how do you enjoying living under a rock i ve thought about moving there recently any tips would be helpful,19
wanted to kill the drake with his ult for style points,13
not really it s just a stun tristana w is not a jump per se but actually a dash with a jump animation,22
would the rework come with a new musical theme for rell i liked the first song and wouldn t mind another one d,23
where did he says that after game interview,8
clg backing off from the baron felt so refreshing and anxiety deducing,11
riot really doesn t want a bot lane meta huh,9
other than morde cuz he fits so well and pyke that started the line and set bar high the rest were disappointing,22
but its not worth flipping the lane when there are better counters available,13
clean by trymbi,3
is leo99 your goat,4
just track it bro,4
should ve been perkz and rekkles on fnc but oh well,10
as soon as i saw fnatic having more than points i closed the image,15
would be fun to have him back we ll see feels like a few teams could benefit from his experience,19
it s only natural that the two undisputed goats of north america with historic international runs would win doublelift and bjergsen never stood a chance,24
no they re really not that s kinda the whole problem with balancing around them,13
no shot ruby plays in the lec next split th vetheo,11
100t changing coaches but drafting the same lazy way you can t fool me i m familiar with your game,18
top income in the world is like 40k yr thats still not high elo richness even if you can turbosmurf on somali kids same for d4,26
better end up removing from valorant at the very least,10
he climbed to d2 before doing that then destroyed his account by first timing bs every 5games you can t luck into master korea rofl,22
it was last pick,4
also for morgana especially zhonyas synergises with her ultimate so incredibly well,12
upset,1
the train derailment in ohio was actually big dhoke s sion changing course to mid lane,15
break my eggs daddy,4
you don t realize how much more tools the website will have watch the video and then make a judgement,19
i mean shoving yourself into a full team as azir for the miracle shurima shuffle vs g2 is the same kind of risk play,24
its not about one player they make really bad decisions that cost them the entire game,16
armor per level outgrows lethality even carries end up near armor by lvl,15
what a joke dl has been good throughout the split and has easily been 100t s best player he s closer to 2nd all pro than he is to not being 3rd all pro,32
by now we should be aware that zven is considerably better with abilities were you have to click on teammates compared to enemies p,24
i love stirrup stockings so much,6
100t sweep in a row rocket doesn t stop half way,11
lol i guess if that s the way you wanna play it rules lawyering the vernacular definitions of getting work done be my guest,23
sylas is just a garbage pick atm doubt anyone higher than gold can cry about him,16
ok riot but real talk i d rather someone call me a racial slur than int my promos like if i dont wanna speak i just mute,28
sivir zeri and draven easily best with milio sivir might be too op with milio in pro play spell shield aoe cleanse shield and a heal is too much protection for sivir,33
that game is a metaphor of xl s current competitive season lol,11
fly has gotten so bad crazy to see,8
clg just took the weirdest path out of the pit,10
will nisqy get gragas again,5
reading that gives me c9 at worlds flashbacks,8
lgd will win,3
bo3 playoffs,3
bdsm are back just fucking the other team this time,10
i know it is off topic but i miss oracle potion i hate that i have to rely on a slow ass minion to walk forward if the enemy team has a teemo or shaco,35
so why do we have resets a season then 4fun ofc,12
link the game,3
easy to do when all you have to do is walk past the tanks that are too busy flanking to peel and wukong ult all three adcs,27
nesquick keeps showing up,4
percent health true damage execute that just kinda remains on the map for seconds and can execute dragon baron yup yup,20
gt gt system buffs lt lt gt gt death s dance ok but why are we buffing a winrate item,17
as a hec otp this is bs those jngs aren t that bad hecs worst counter is yi and khazix and kindred if she invades u those are untouched,29
one of the most ape engages i ve ever seen from bugi,11
but not champ q,4
can t tell if you just can t figure it out or if you re just too much of a pedantic redditor to acknowledge how obvious it is what was meant,28
pix could use a touch up,6
galaxy brain,2
because g2 is the only guaranteed msi team plus their coach and casters keep talking how this team is set up for international success,24
there s a reason why this match is so late in the eu you have to use the timeslot,19
is my favorite top to study to improve i think there s nothing wrong with playing a steady and controlled game but i do agree it s funny how reserved players get after a few yrs of pro,37
this is so surprising to me that so many people use the in game recommendations they are so bad weird nonsense from my experience,21
i played rengar top lane and usually split pushed to see whether enemies come i bought a wardstone to always have wards,22
not sure what kind of cursed blessed timeline we are in that there is reasonable chance of astralis bds taking the first two lec spots what a time to be alive,29
how it s not even blue,5
holy shit that poor morde nice murdering ya kha nerd,10
maybe taliyah but she s still a teenager not a child,10
we are arguing about a game why you getting tilted lol i would have answers but tbh with your attitude im gonna pass i can imagine your in game behaviour from this reply,33
keep yamato forever lec plz,5
idk why but this feels like it could become a pasta,11
100t jackspektra,2
yeah i don t fully understand the interactions but that felt off to me as well,15
it s part of the ocean rift if you have certain settings i believe,13
no its not a welcome change tabis are op and are to be nerfed for a long time now we dont need anothery change that makes it stronger terrible change,30
to see the lehends viper botlane again would ve been so sick,10
she doesn t have the voice to do flowers type casting the other guy tries that and he sounds terrible,19
they def have a do nothing and lose feel atm like there s nothing wrong with going for scaling but if that s all you do you re one dimensional as a team,30
you just named good mid laners grats i guess,10
it s called saltyteemo and it still exists live right now,10
beryl was right winning worlds is all luck,8
i fear this one may be a big oof,9
well that was a reply,6
you d get flamed in text chat for not joining voice at least that s what happens in every other voice chat game lol,22
lulu top was a thing for a long time,9
yet they stills don t build it that should tell you a thing or two about the state of the item,20
true still there s angles where he is enough it s bad but so is any other off meta build,18
recently found xayah and she constantly brags about how everyone else is just insufferable and needs to be stabbed except rakan considering the standart league game it feels totaly relatable,30
what part of my comment is particularly impassioned,8
th thebausffs wp by this sion,6
oh you re approaching me instead of running away you re coming right to me i cant gnarmut the shit out of you without getting close oh ho then come as close as you like proceeds to get gnarmut d and lose the game,41
mages shouldn t be getting demonic as a defensive option either zhonya s rylai s and seraph s are overall much better just consider demonic a dead item for mages because really that what it is it s supposed to be geared toward melee aps,40
you cannot preach to a man who does not understand the language carl jung letters vol pages,19
if ls did stuff like this people would probably actually listen lmfao,12
all the tanks games he played this year don t look very good maybe he s just a carry top player,19
god fucking forbid she give an explanation just because other people haven t right,13
she s buffed because a single target assassin whose core mechanic is dive headfirst into my opponent doesn t work that well when the entire enemy team is always together,28
besides statis is still statis,5
what a banger that last game hle was in the lead for like of the game but couldn t close it out,22
come on now there is no way people really hate teemo in theres things way worse than him that came out in theses years when the demon teemo meme was relevant,33
i still feel like the full game graph shows all of that information on the other hand if the game state changed significantly minutes ago then we would have no idea,31
i don t know if i ve ever seen licorice play gwen,10
yeah but don t you know that of the playerbase are all shitters who should just uninstall,17
this is how i feel with hec when i play against him he s the horseman of death dealing insane damage and tanky when i play as him i barley do damage and i m a wet noodle,36
monster burly men champs never played no matter how op they could be,12
all i want is conductor ornn let me bonk people with a train riot trucker ornn close second,18
yes just ban zeri that s how you beat cloud9 berserker is a zeri otp lmao,15
ironically the vast gulf in levels was probably why he couldn t figure it out zac was barely tickling him so it wasn t as obvious he was being hit by anything,30
sounds like it s in riots best interest to stick to their marketing plan and let africa be africa,18
my game and of my friends had the same issue one of them reported not getting loss mitigated the others are still stuck,24
despite koi s best efforts to throw th were adamant to toss back the win at every possible moment when it counted that being said szygenda was insane,27
bro is making people,5
baus playstyle would get abused hard in pro play,9
it s a metaphor for addiction,5
worst chapter best memes,4
i m maybe wrong but wasn t dl nuts on xayah recently i know rakan was perma banned but at least he has peel himself not hoping busio finds his w key,30
i ve experienced this as well and it makes it feel like the mitigation was worthless it does make sense how this kind of thing would be overlooked but hopefully riot will readjust this accordingly soon,35
there s a lot of people arguing against democracy here lol,10
korean talent is leagues above american talent wait till msi and watch t1 dismantling fq and c9 though,18
honestly i stopped watching cod when he stopped casting so i m loving this crossover,14
ah yes pac man and tetris games the size of league that have patches on a bi weekly basis with regularly new content added but yes people do in fact still play pac man and tetris to this day,36
make her receive of her host damage please please,11
the fact that theshy goes for aggressive 1v1 plays sometimes backfired on him but he puts enormous pressure on the entire map by doing this and can single handedly carry games this way and win 1v2s easily,36
yeah esp in g2 he tool many qs from ezreal which he cud have avoided before team fight,18
not really because mage archetypes don t follow ranged melee distinctions themselves leblanc is a ranged assassin swain is a ranged bruiser etc,21
zeka is great on certain picks sylas akali yone so mostly melee champs but once he has to play different champs he looks clueless so i wouldn t say he is a fraud but he is certainly limited champ pool wise,40
you re right and i wonder how much the og casters of lck helped that monte doa and papa smithy were trademarks of the lck cast and it feels that even if the names change the cast level is the same,40
i didnt understand a single word there but bot diff almost lost drx the match that is a fact,19
get dl a midlaner please holy shit,7
guys surely father doublelift on jinx can carry our lifeless bodies across the finish line right lock it in fuck it,22
i m guessing you haven t heard charlie talk about this he wants no vc or big ownership funding,17
markz had nothing to work look at game s cast when they also had jensen markz created so much dialogue with jensen while letigress didn t say anything to him at all outside of before match start,36
i thought it was last enemy knocked up,8
gt be rp only perfection and beauty are allowed at this tier haha hmm i wonder who this might be,26
i went to sleep mad because we dropped a game to reddit brian and it could fuck us in match score then woke up to this guess i ll just trust the plan,32
too much drinking na kool aid made me forget that she s supposed to do damage midgame,16
you missed the option for before promos existed realistically though i think it is subjective i liked it more pre role selection because i played every role but other people that didn t would obviously find it harder,36
dwg vs drx summer final game the snwoball they did was just crazy,15
this is the tl we were promised,7
that s not what i m saying i think dl is the best na talent ever nothing about passion or age or whatever,21
are you okay they die in two spells if they get hit by anything,14
heck the qs range is long enough and it ignores walls so often times he doesn t wq aggressively he wqs away into a wall or just diagonally,27
the most successful coach in league of legends history was hardstuck gold get the fuck out of here with these bullshit takes you don t know jack shit about what coaching entails,31
you re still thinking about recent ish history to be honest,9
lee syndrome baby,3
veigar passive morgana q twitch w cassiopeia e khartus ult you stun someone poison the and farm stack for massive ap until you can one shot anyone with your ap khartus ult,33
fluke what a throw,4
it pretty much were the dreamhacks back then were at the end of the day just big lans with some tournaments going on,23
you re not wrong it wasn t because of sk though xl just kinda did nothing all game,16
did you read the post past the title,8
i really wish there was another tier to boots,9
yes this i like bloodline for champs where realistically i can t grab lifesteal till like item it s pretty lame that it s being nerfed considering isn t exactly mind blowing,30
ah yeah the riot s special for gp nerf him to winrate then nerf the problematic item,17
i dont think peter dunn is fast to bench players and normally im not a fan of that either but in this case at least mid needs to go and asap,31
we are watching different games,5
keeping anybody besides jankos and mersa is questionable,8
i cannot get behind ender i dont know what it is i dont even think he s bad i just i dont know,23
viktor is great weak early but does well in certain match ups ok at lvl great after mythic up until late game,23
what team are you routing for,6
i just wish i could understand a word jiizuke says heavy accent slurring words fucks me up,18
maybe he is used to g2 times when they could troll but also win games because the atmosphere was so great,21
not just full time pay but easily top percentile of salaries,12
the blitz pick was complete garbage macro completely set themselves up to die,13
welp azael s bringing out the improper use of the word index again thought that was done,16
its like one of the moments where people see humanoid and rekkles didnt hug after win and decide they have beef between them,23
another steve failure but don t worry guys if imports doesn t work will,15
sounds like i m slapping anathemas on his ass then,9
i am so glad they dont let people like you balance the game,13
or passive on old yuumi,5
yea i think upset is good but idk how people can say hes the best eu has ever had when hes achieved nothing even with good teams,27
how can u duplicate a champ while giving it another nonexistent value,12
aiming was robbed,3
in higher elos players definitely care though and strategy would absolutely change in pro play if the change is neutral for players who don t care and positive for players who do then i think it s a positive change,38
everyone likes to smack others while sometimes you get smacked too bombastic hopium,13
it s funny how much research people will do to find discrepancies in champion stats to complain about the game but not use that time to research how to play the game or build proper items lol,36
was pulse play by play,5
but most of the people expoliting it are using smurfs,10
i don t think he means they will stomp them more like they are favored against all of them,18
wtf is lec doing with their vods and why is the chat getting removed why can t they be normal,19
abedagge blink twice if your being held hostage,8
sure as hell ain t seeing fnc go to playoffs,9
silver doesnt exist but if he s silver tell him you re silver and i should get my advice from better players,23
azir gets some pro play nerf into the ground zeri not in for weeks this champ needs buffs rito logic xd,22
that s a horrible category because the juggernauts have overtuned damage and stats,12
you said overreactions but these are all true g2 vs vit is the msi final fnc the dream jankos is stuck in elo hell,25
astralis are such gigachads pick full ad comp with jax irelia and just skill check the enemy completely styled on them on multiple occasions,24
depends on the outcome of this game i think it s minimum though,13
skipped promos anyways when i hit 100lp the 2nd time,10
catch me banning ivern to guarantee he s not on my team,11
i feel like most of the complaints were about how bad the shield numbers were i don t see anyone complaining about it after it got buffed jarvan is doing really well since then,33
both yep,2
he said that it s not the reason they lost and the missed draven ban was probably because they were prepping for a different side so they needed to rethink their preferences fast,32
i think that was true when he debuted but it s been a few years since then,16
it s not penta until fat lady stops singing,8
omg ry0ma could have gotten so many gold stars,9
evelynn rengar or talon i d guess,6
how much me,3
yeah that was the first thing that came to mind too but i imagine it s too old by now,19
gt i think this is the best comic we got so far i think it s zed and ashe both hard gap kat and lux imo,26
death taxes doublelift doing some dumb shit in critical moments,10
kind of feels like riot forgot all about the glade i always wanted the glade to have more champions that kind serve as the opposite of the void champions,29
shaco because he has no lore,6
god forbids someone takes darius vs these sion picks,9
just ok would be better than eyla right now though thats the problem wish fq had a jg sub too tho for this series spica is getting as gapped as eyla,31
would you rather they regurgitate the same points after only one game,12
hmm did that last fbi auto killed him,8
i must have missed that then now i feel old and miss old sion s voicelines who is your summoner and what does he do among others,26
they are not only buffing her they are nerfing other adcs aswell which makes it be a big power shift,20
that s the case with a lot of unpopular champs at least for of players they aren t bad but rly unpopular which makes it difficult for riot to buff them,30
he pretty funny imo,4
bolulu trying his best to drag imts decaying corpse,9
that tp was so disrespectful rakan was right there and the exact same thing happened to bds when they did that play earlier this week,25
who hates jojo or perkz and what does this have to do with people criticizing how they perform amp x200b hint you can love both and still call them out on bad plays games series,32
maybe now people will stop talking about sk like they are a good team sk at msi wouldnt be bad lmao,21
kinda weird because their valorant team isn t even in the franchised league not sure how the valorant esport system work though,21
he s not technically a rookie he was their starting adc last season but struggled early on and they replaced him with prince during he season,25
not my inability my teammates inability big difference a competent person would look it up my teams play like they saw the champ bought them went straight to ranked then started looking at what the champ could do,38
i like using the swain emote where he s looking sideways i think it s called something like oh wow or something like that works great for those situations,27
this is true character growth,5
unfortunately i started playing league in season i didn t get to see monte s casting,15
busio skilled player but that is not normally this very very insane they need to check him pc and game maybe he not cheating but maybe he using the game deficit and this cant seem on game screen he needs to check up,39
he really isn t broken but he s also not weak hecarim is in a doesnt need buffs or nerfs state broken was before his q was hard nerfed on preseason,29
for grreat science of course,5
exactly what i was thinking not a single good ult all game long,13
it sure does feel great not being able to play the game if enemy team has any amount of slowing,20
i don t feel bad for you as another tsm fan you took our basketball team and kd,17
they would ve still had a bunch of opportunities to practice it since ap jungle gragas has been a thing several times over the years,24
thanks i will try to continue doing it with most of it automated except for writing the texts i should be able to do it still even when i am back at work,33
the rest of the team had flaws as well but neon had a really bad split even when he did good kaiser was fucking up the lane,27
i never played her for years strictly because she killed me with ignites and a few autoattacks before level still remember that game vividly years later on why that was even possible,34
so how did that comment age for you,8
doesn t matter what their role is nobody is saying pbp has to be male people think misogyny is the problem which it just isn t,24
holy moly this is what a pro league looks like great job both teams no other region can compare to the skill level of these teams,26
i d love it if they gave kangas and or rafa more pbp slots in lcs,14
i did play on wednesday how can i get that patch,11
the real loser of this is eu s chances at msi,10
what server are you on euw and it s the same for me every other games streams zoom calls run smooth but every 2nd league game comes with package loss it s been fucking annoying,33
yes new accounts have positive lp gains and losses which makes it way more relaxing easy to climb everoyne knows this that doesnt take away the fact that abusing a system to get good gains is fair and isnt actually cheating disgusting,41
sounds like u try to solo win the game and if u mess up u tilt and int,18
asking for people s op gg,4
bugi flashing for the varus twice now has bit him in the ass,13
the worst was worlds when his only good teammate kakao inted his brains out and idiots blamed rookie for not getting out of groups no pro player has been elo hell d as much as rookie,36
he was getting a lot more kills on braum that you d normally expect,13
yes it seems balanced probably a little under tuned in reality,11
paper pictures ass,3
eyla is dogwater luckily he s australian so papa will never remove him,12
sorry what was the point of this post anyone with brain cells understood what dardoch meant,17
still waiting for his w passive to come back,9
i would much rather zed be pickrate than anivia break through pickrate,14
turtle was just years ahead of the meta i see it now,13
how many teemos you seeing in proplay and why shouldnt his q work that way plenty of champs have ranged damage,21
he d probably be played solo lane like lucian was before they gutted him,13
it was not even close to unbalanced almost no champions bought it,12
dude i tried i tried so hard to give it a chance where was the hype in that last baron fight call cmon bring back that dude from yesterday,29
before he was a streamer and 100t co owner he was a call of duty caster who still co streams cdl on occasion edit punctuation,24
tbh i think because of it we had him for nac iv a blessing in disguise to me,18
this guy is not even an edg fan his account only exists to shit on t1 especially guma there is literally no reason to take anything he says seriously,29
revenge to gg pls,4
yes i didnt,4
doesn t quite work like that they got the first installments and get to keep that they just won t get anymore,20
doesn t even look like or resemble orianna the only recognisable feature is the ball,14
so you got one guy who said grabbz was the best coach ever and one guy who said grabbz was terrible if i trust your translation this doesnt proof shit just that people have different opinions,36
what comeback lmao that s just creating narrative,7
play shyvana mid with doran shield start like those koreans do shyvana in jg is hard you have no cc weak early and you are going to be punished by aggressive early game jgs like ls or jarvan,38
how are olaf wukong and heimerdinger off the radar,8
bds actually most fun team to watch with g2 really rooting for them to go to msi,17
was it peter dun s doing because i swear reddit told me that dude was a good manger yet they ended up with two highly questionable imports,26
people will rightfully criticize jankos for that rest before baron but the non existent top and mid is really keeping heretics from being a good team,25
okay but that s not what the rune is for so is it really a nerf,15
scissors need buffs rock needs nerfs paper is fine the hashinshin motto,12
oh i had no idea in the lore comics sylas beats garen in that first encounter when he escapes prison execution,20
nilah plays conqueror,3
it s super funny bro keep it up forthekids,8
mouse button for me ez mode,7
agreed,1
but if it was purged why is it still shown if its shown it has to be stored somewhere right,20
i gain a win,5
i read that as meatbreaker and wondered which degenerate sub did i just join,14
anyone else wanna see what oscar vs zeus kiin would look like,11
problem solved you have too be in her w for it too proc,13
well faker did that earlier today and it was pretty sick so,12
nice troll post but kinda low effort,7
let s go fnatic,4
lol you can still get chatbanned in arams and i played ranked normals for years and never got a single chat ban account since season thousands of games played,29
so they are actually killing rammus wow,7
how did you make the chest it s amazing,8
i got chatbanned for saying sorry guys i m retarded after flashing under the enemy turret and dying,17
maybe because they re too strong right now,7
jankos gt yoya,3
they lost vs drx at worlds o o,7
ty ill take a look to it when i can,10
i think making it more like old taliyah wall any damage stops the wall surf would be a better change than like new taliyah wall which is what you re describing,30
you can mute him he did nothing bad that s normal,10
i mean that because ibai is friends with him and if g2 stays with yike i don t see any better opportunity for him,23
bro lol he s fast in terms of pressing w and running across the map in seconds,17
ap kayle flashbacks,3
it seems like you miss the point at the end,10
i ve never seen so many throws in a game both teams just taking turns at this point lol,18
you dare give me a logical solution to my problem i came here to scream my frustrations in the largest echo chamber on the planet not to be a reasonable member of society,33
no i m just saying from riot s pov,7
my bad didnt realize the guy above and you were talking about aram since the post was about a rift game i was assuming were talking about that,27
berserker is a really accurate name,6
another pause aware,3
his winrate went up like but his pick rate in high elo pro skyrockrted the buffs are not mere placebo they arent massive but it helps a good bit,31
i appreciate the individual gold diffs,6
this is the main reason i still come back here browse new and bawl my eyes out for papa rito obviously because i want to and not because i can not move on with my life,36
pls leave asol alone,4
this draft sucks so bad for koi,7
it s a new support each game but the same adc you got one guess,14
it s the cc machine that my blitzcrank hooks on top of me to kill me,15
feels good to watch 100t lose even as a 100t fan lol what an absolutely embarrassing team,17
short answer adrenaline long answer one support catches the enemy with their cc and then its full committal regardless of lane priorities,22
probably the buffs felt unwarranted but then again the only cleaver bruiser who s overperforming is wukong so maybe not,19
based trynd rng making redditors seethe,6
maybe it s isp not riot if they re not posting i haven t seen people posting their isp so it s hard to say anything other than standard riot bad,27
should be banned from competitive,5
wdym teemo is still an extremely annoying champion even is it not broken like his kit is designed to be annoying xd,22
put licroice on tanks please and pick a hardcarry for bot and play to it,15
deserved for playing teemo top,5
i am thriving,3
the entire world is part of the kt rollercoaster what a team,12
aren t you supporting my point that the slow is what s problematic damage is basically a non factor you can t argue the movespeed matters considering lulu can also provide vigilance and movespeed with one skill as well,36
i don t wanna see carzzy versus guma and ruler mad please go,13
agreed sometimes i feel like i must be watching an entirely different set of games from the casters analysts with how much garbage they spew about how good he is,29
hope i start getting some of those for the brain dead support and jgs in my game,17
almost as if you ve never had a manager who makes terrible decisions,12
xl has the best chance to make it if they sneak win and other teams go because they have tougher opponents but idk it s fight between mental boomed elyoya vs depressed odo vs joker arc jankos,39
cos yas and yone never abused sbow they are the most intended users of those items sbow only ever got nerfed cos of adcs kog vayne and akshan mostly,29
they re totally setting him up to be the sandbag lol,10
you were never banned at least not this account,9
soloq games have been stomps of the games since you should know this as youve been stuck in plat low diamond for seasons pre decided just ur mental,31
that meta developed for a long time the original zzrot meta was against tank tops who couldn t clear the portal then the changes started rolling in d,27
these are cute and awesome d,6
thanks forgot about the passive,5
gt people who play aram see the all chat text end if gay in almost every other game false i see end if straight way more often,26
i love this theater set up for the analyst desk i like being able to watch the analysts while also seeing a really good view of the play,28
meanwhile they vct has dash and the lcs studio during the weekends,12
hard sell with the narcoboat hahah,6
oh i agree with sitting on stopwatch it s just maybe my personal bias of thinking cosmic is kinda busted on ahri but zhonyas is still a good buy,29
welcome back comp,3
well tbf bo1s are a coinflip we ll see in the coming weeks with the bo5s,15
she can w q r and considerably damage an enemy if they re not grouped up and unlike others she can retreat if needed,23
so you prefer and nearest airport,7
true and based,3
we re not talking options here we re talking specific class types and every mage can be played in bot technically so if you were to talk options there s a lot for bot,31
ya this is normal low elo over commits on drake s to lose games,13
from the outside fanatic looks way more boomed than excel even if their players are arguably better i don t have high hopes for spring,24
this draft music is amazing it gives me jrpg adventuring vibes,11
but i want it now,5
i thought he was ceo now i remember he was gm for 100t,13
counter point flex queue have disable party of because pf the environment it created for the solo player voice chat could replicate the same problem,27
yeah i tend to go q gt w gt e but extra points in e is always powerful that boost slow is beautiful,19
gutting bloodline again lmaoo,4
fair but again of them are obvious the only one i thought you could do but couldn t is both catalyst items,22
seems like it went down hill since then lol partnering with overwolf killed it for me sadge,17
can tell you have way too much time if you d rather play a 4v5 than ff to go next one,20
this is legitimately the only side of the story we ve heard what the fuck are you talking about,18
they picked a bad day to stop sniffing glue,9
bro you cant just walk in and not give us the cookie tier list,14
just be a bigot and use the derogatory slurs all you want because that s what this whole discussion is about didn t think that so many people hate that they can t be ableist racist etc in league chat as easy anymore,40
yee you do,3
oscar gigachad,2
looks like the guy did get to masters himself but then demoted and stuck and got a booster lmao,19
sure and he deserves credit for that but you can t ignore that that s a reflection of the whole team s earlygame keria faker oner have a large impact on that too,28
yessir we made it this far,6
people are quick to ff in high elo so no time for her to shine still a qol buff would be nice,22
palafox does not want to lose this game,8
exactly even with ultimate i could never catch a singed or garen you need your bork active and ultimate or ghost on top of it all to chase them down,30
considering this affects lux and ziggs passives it does affect characters that should be building horizon focus,17
pls allow fnatic to ff pls,6
he s the youngest player by a fair margin december in my knowledge he s one of the only two players born in the other being kdf bulldog,28
jhin xayah and cait have all been meta before when galeforce didn t exist this is just not true as an adc main i think galeforce should not exist its a bullshit item,32
oh most def,3
i only play aram what the fuck am i going to do with a ward skin,16
ruby wtf,2
ahh another let s talk about tanks post that s all about mundo,11
if they re such a big commitment why do much smaller games with much smaller resources and playerbases manage to support them the problem was riot s management of the game not that maps are that risky,36
is per side really that good i heard a lot of high elo players don t like it and use fixed could honestly help me out too if it s actually better,29
tbh it s probably just a mindset reset you can tell by watching his games that he is much less tilted and more willing to roam which were his biggest weaknesses before,32
d is for dance and f is for fuck you,10
i m clenching so hard hoping he s not summit i also think emenes plays way better on mobile champions than immobile ones more buttons means more ways to outplay,29
so riot no fan of monster gals i take it,10
a lot of the results are probably cause people are voting on champs they don t play or only occasionally play,20
i think karis is serviceable as a midtier midlaner if given the time but it s true that the support pool in lck is rough,24
g2 with the funni draft but ast looking legit,9
targamas is a good roming sup but he is mute so thats a problem if you are not great in lane,21
idk it worked in all the games that 100t lost in playoffs,12
ha i m na i just like watching lec is all,10
zed s was the worst one shen was a raging psychopath the whole way through the twist was dumb as well revive a dead character and make him do a heel turn that completely negates him as character comic sucked,39
nah the haste you get is gold worth for gold increase plus the majority of champs that like nashors also like haste,24
like i said imho best choice would be ibo jankos zwyroo noah kabbie i can t see a point in getting wubder when your academy toplaner is so good,28
stick to one role,4
you re tripping on the wr in roles mid veigar is still meh bot lane is just back to it s winrate to what it was about months ago just with much higher pr,35
yayy yuumi,2
yeah man if my so started playing teemo after i died i break out of the afterlife just to slap them,21
huhi is the king thief next up former gm papasmithy,10
yeah lck casters do a pretty good cast for the lck games i do prefer my lec casters and even though i don t watch lcs anymore captainflowers is the fucking beast i love that guy,35
anal correction here blitz has a much higher winrate in plat than bronze,13
what s your main,3
there must be something wrong with your system if a single video clip causes absurd mem leakage and eats ram like that isn t normal,24
welp we re fucked yet another split thanks for keeping dardo,10
don t insult wildturtle dyrus xpecial santorin the general and all the other great players that played pre,17
yup she s not hindering the game like she was before which is massive actually,14
if the token gain would be reasonable it would be okay i remember back in season you could get one orb per day from playing,26
already knew but glad to remind myself that i share the same name as big dick daddy,17
chain dying captain flowers it s accurate vicla was lost today,11
bro why would you publicize your mistake like this lol you used everything then chased him under tower what did you expect to happen,24
gg too good,3
this is no different than old mmr system but with accelerated gains or losses are you holding a positive wr in the division you climbed to are you losing at lp and in debt to the system,38
only because most of reddit is silver stuff like annie that 0s you after a point and click stun is far more cancerous,23
oscarinen arrived,2
i hate yone,3
i think the main reason why viper goes back to korea is because of the asian games which is going to happen this year,24
it doesn t even look like something happened there so i don t really think they have made any changes,18
look i agree with you in principle but there s no need to go so hard,15
fnc didnt play well in any of the games they won koi looked like soloq we will see in msi,20
that was actually deft s call btw although beryl did come up with the hecarim idea,15
clg is looking resilient good to see luger doing some work,11
its been over since toplane became purely stat checking because every other champ has a similar identity purpose so you just pick the strongest numerical one now big papa garen is up there when darius exists but graves and lucian can t coexist,40
you can t outban him tbh and maybe heretics have been doing good with jarvan in scrims,16
oh yeah the last time we heard from malphite he was still in zaun right anyhow an interaction between him and milio can be very cute,26
man tes what was that,5
omg aren t super good but they thrive on beating teams with their pocket picks which is why they will never succeed at worlds,23
yeah i ve thought about that too and i just hope it doesn t turn into rock paper scissors lol,16
ast was ready for every g2 play,7
not sure luger taking cleanse against a triple knock up comp was a smart choice,14
supports in bot lane trying to level up their starter for the dragon gym using wards to stop their starter from hurting themself in their confusion and raging when their starter misses a cth skill when it matters most,40
yeah who is not interested to learn korean from a stranger who i dont know if he learnt korean from noodle packages,22
thats an answer i gave in regard to champion diversity the topic at hand,14
fnatic a british org and head quarters are in the uk so with the fact he s the gm means it wouldn t surprise me if he s based in the uk as well and has a contract under uk labour laws,39
i love deft a lot but after a really great start to the split he s not been on the same level the past few matches was gapped by guma and now was completely outmatched by peyz,36
everything was a problem this series i m just saying from management s pov you can t really replace sm canyon deft kellin s been fine so the only one left is canna since they have thanatos who has been looking really good,39
objective two guaranteed failed shes the perfect champ for any team with a good adc and mediocre support or any team with a fantastic adc slap this cat on viper and he will actually be able to 1v9 for hle,40
im sure you will base instantly after meeting twitch,10
is he frontrunner for lck mvp,6
fleet is perfect for daven just it sucks,8
looks like a script especially the dodge for the xerath w,11
there s only tyler1,4
that s fair welp i tried,5
you did duo to get masters tho neace did not,10
every runescape player knows lol,5
obvious dodge in selection,4
lugerr breathing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxidee,7
shieldbow overheal bt good luck trying to kill that put a lulu in it or yuumi and its gg,20
top lane is a man s lane if you can t destroy them 1v2 top them don t queue up,17
vasili hit slapped teammates too he doesn t discriminate between genders,9
i think not joining voicechat would actually put a target on your back for the rest to be toxic towards you,21
riot s server,2
that s not chinese style art what that s just what modern league art has looked like for years look at lor cards,21
the hacarim on gv was mid,6
the team is called we short for world elite lol,10
yea people all of suden blame fnc for promoting him which is prob a dream of every academy player to be promoted to lec team,25
now i want the list of all pro players documenting which key they have flash on only thing i know is doublelift have the flash key unbinded sometime,28
itt people totally ignoring the disclaimer in the first sec of the video,14
these fly engages are tilting me,6
their shared brain cell orbit around them as they try to connect to it with their wifi but they happen to have dsl bandwidth,24
that s what i think that i smited trynda xd,9
yesterday players wanted to surrender one said no and one player left the game long time we could not surrender but its the majority,25
glad tes won and was nice to see wayward play well damn lwx is stuck in elo hell,18
alright is noona the artist,5
his kennen and jayce are nasty op too,8
lpl casting is a good lullaby,6
he didn t step down he got benched,7
the real riot support,4
eg is playing as bad as gamerdoc and nicole treated danny,11
i hope whoever pitched the veigar range buff steps on a lego,12
there s no excuse for the pathing junglers are taking this late in the meta lvl you have to be bot lane especially in this type of lanes,28
xl out of the scene what is happening,8
how much resource individuals get on a team aka where the gold is funneled to post min so it brings context rather than x player is bad look at his items,32
bro i would argue that zed is as safe if not safer than akali or sylas he s lb tier safe,20
guess i m just a hextech hater then i just don t like how quickly the enemy is able to get out on the map after respawning but i guess it s different strokes for different folks,34
i just have no idea what they re doing how is elise supposed to counter gank when jarvan eq into thresh cc and draven exists,23
yep canna outperformed kingen for most of those games,9
hmh yeah that makes sense actually fair point,8
op doesn t know that sona seraphine fasting senna and rengar ivern are still insanely broken bot,16
could have seen,3
yeah it ll be a viktor vlad only kind of item,9
unfair comparisons also there s a reason why not a lot of people play dota and hots,16
typical xerxe zero ganks and still only even behind in farm,10
yes but then when you win you get more lp and climb faster because your mmr is much higher than the visual rank,23
you can get perm banned for using this app,9
it s sad but we will never see bjerg in his prime again i would love to see it but it s just a different game now and the skill level has risen while he has objectively become worse,37
seems like we are going from most unpredictable and banger day to the complete opposite,15
theoretically speaking he do people who grind for years have all champs and collect be from shards after that update shards would cost lower so they get lower be for their grinding,32
they haven t missed playoffs since spring,7
this seems like a perfect angle to get catforkobe trending again,11
you could hear so hard he quickshot is a fnatic fan and wanted that they win,16
in reginald s case it was more started because of a petulant ego war that dl started because he was salty,20
coach diff i suppose,4
care to share,3
people complaining about getting gank and not using their wards name me a more perfect duo,16
so the entry threshold into the game for newcomers is very high,12
frauds beings frauds again what else is new,8
do you think everyone in korea is famous,8
cry more bro idk what you want to hear,9
yea true they are a top tier league team loser,10
i am not a fan of his casting either though not for the reasons you listed but you can t get away with saying that here because he s not a woman,30
ask dardo,2
vicla played the early game insanely well too a battle of two carries and in the mid game draven reigned supreme,21
ok hans and upset,4
but did you ever play malph vs darius you know you can just q and back off xd you play tank you can be behind in cs because your job is to ult not to be hypercarry xd,38
kripp as in kripparian,4
i usually just ban lux or samira lol,8
ok i m sorry but rekkles has been impactful in fights thus far in two games that s bad,18
what s the name of the interviewer,6
they nerf his late game power so much to compensate for his ridiculous early game that s why his win rate was bad,22
just save your cage until morde ults,7
who the fuck added male on velkoz or kogmaw,10
if u dont win worlds ur overrated apparently,8
keep kayle ryze singed amp twisted fate until as they re going higher rest can be dusted and a handful of them cost more now than they would after the changes so its best to do those now,38
you should remove the part of you that cringes,9
some next level seething coming from the riot fan boy,10
nilah fits all the traits of a marksman except having range less lol,14
busio looked alright game but his thresh in games and left a lot to be desired,19
people underestimate kt a lot if lck wasn t points based they will be second place,15
dont take otherwise lcs authorities should watch some of these matches again nd i hope they realize how irritating that sounds,21
and ii,2
they arent chromas its just silver or gold glow to indicate star level,13
the people who don t like losing minute games off one big misplay are more vocal than the people who don t like minute games as the norm,28
let s be real if it takes you years to be bronze silver it s time to get a brain scan because your life might be in danger,25
the challenge with this is that i think na is falling further and further behind the international competition so getting a deep run is going to be more and more rare,31
clg have been the smartest lcs team since last summer,10
you d think mentioning him in the patch notes would be enough,11
oh i didn t know that thanks,6
also almost all anivias run pom to help with mana even more if there s a champ that s still mana gated it s her,22
it s just like steam achievements just a percentage of what achievements in game you completed so you re like done in bronze for whatever,24
mejais on a fed ruby is pretty intimidating ngl,9
if the person yuumi is attached to is taking less damage from all sources heals shields on that champion are going to be not more effective since their health will lower slower but healing isn t changed,37
i think it means that when asked during the whole week they were told they were blue hence told blue side all week at least that s how i interpreted it,30
as opposed to a world where ziggs can lame out games and also be able to bust a kneecap with every q hit,23
she uses navori which is also an crit amplifier but instead of usual auto attacks its more based on the skills so eben without ie she still is nota crit champ just simply focusing on the skills via navoris,39
since when malphite is supposed to be one of his picks,12
bushio won player of the game right,7
nice user name makes sense now,6
thank you this is a really good explanation for why he took harvester,13
the trucks would be driving through their hq at that point,11
flashback to faker sending s3 supports to the shadow realm in under seconds with his gragas,17
ngl i always thought deafen was the same as mute i m gonna use this from now on i don t usually find raging keyboard warriors thank god but when i do this is going to come in handy,37
of the league community is suffering this disease,9
try starting the practise tool and dodge the champ select sounds weird ik try again starting a blind pick,19
imagine eyla not inting first dragon and rift,8
and he went at msi and at worlds in his first year in what should ve been a relatively easy group that g2 was favored to get out of,30
benched for who they already tried the other academy support how many supports do you think they have,18
i d be surprised if they don t pickup a new adc,10
t1 adc gt dwg adc,5
thats bullshit good fiora recks a good jax easily she can kite and riposte and even force stuns with q w its way more fiora favored maybe not for you but actually it is,33
one of the best lck bo5s i ve seen in a while faker s gragas ults in game kept them in the game,22
op gg,2
just fyi good game university was one game away from beating tsm for the na lcs spring title,20
zed lol tryndamere and illaoi next,7
no not usually typically it would be like leona braum naut but i m still interested in learning a better way to place my hands i only began with qwer because i have a monkey brain and thought abilities fingers,39
upset is not the best adc europe has ever had who is upvoting this,14
not sure about that but one time some hacker changed iwd or some other pro s mmr to bottom tier so they were destroying iron players and were stuck there for a few days,33
oh he definitely isnt playing up to standard but i also feel like literally every team he joins starts off the split strong then falls off a fucking cliff,29
why engage without asol why engage there wtf was that,10
the zhonyas didnt stopped him from ulting if he got the kill he would have gotten chain ccd the same way,21
it s a good thing i didn t say all people on the sub then isn t it,15
hey man if you re gonna jinx us then at least man up and put on a t1 flair,18
anything where the counterplay is just kite them bro yeah no most of those champs are near unkillable and they come at me faster than verstappen,26
suffering from success,3
top to master kalista draven fiora vlad and gp if he wasn t so broken,15
valorant is more chill than league from my experience at least on the sea servers,15
ig u count karma why not count taliyah,8
i mean licorice is okayy being dumb here but balls the d2 god come on now,16
that one is golden,4
maybe not in the same team but have them start a verbal fight if they are on opposite teams,19
comment is enough thanks prison gif emote grin gif emote hug,6
ask yamato if he wants to go bowling,8
tell me your secret build,5
i started back in early and remember playing teemo in every lane and rushing stacking phantom dancers rip old icon as all my items,24
when all of the players are suddenly mechanically washed nothing will work out,14
carzzy good form continnues,4
zeka claiming the kill on cuzz in the dragon pit when there was viper s draven next to him with mins worth of stacks was so frustratng,27
thanks d,1
he has a deceptive winrate because most players are maxing q maxing e has a winrate which is a bit too much i d say,26
szy somehow killing nami there at elder made me laugh and then xl intended their hearts out,17
ssumday is one of my favourite players but let s be real dhokla performed better than ssumday this split brand names really do get an unfair advantage tis unfortunate,28
shes meta in slightly and shes turbo broken so youre right,13
spring split starts march next saturday,7
in ashe was one of the best dps adcs tbf that was pre kaisa aphelios samira,17
tear and pink,4
this this is just total obliteration t1 and their best picks man,12
oh they are from my country lol the username of the rell means cancer to riot games,17
huanfeng and rekkles are also pretty gnarly jhins on their day,11
way higher than ls without duo neace gt ls,9
i dunno if anyone told you but budokai tenkaichi was announced,12
what part of fringe viable and most played in has anything to do with being played in mid a decade ago like he very clearly was not justifying a pick now with logic lol,36
unforgive was clearly sick as fuck if you look at player cams apparently covid was rampaging through teams,18
true would love to see a repeat of that lol,10
just bring unforgiven from academy this guy was amazing last year 100t dosent have a carry,16
nah he was known for his blitzcrank originally while on epik gamer,12
well yes that is in fact the point here,9
why not e from ezreal tho free flash,8
unconventional is fair but both players and coach thought it s good while in draft so no point in giving excuses if g2 wants to get credit for creative drafts they need to eat it when they run it,38
yeah blitz is truly all or nothing,7
i think they said that after seasons the champs will be put into a lower price tier so for zeri season she will be reduced at the start of season,34
they re in the middle of a close ranked game as we speak,12
days since last skin karma kalista fiora ezreal millio first skin not really they were due for a skin,23
yeah all of those last few were kept purposefully weak because their kits were overly simplistic and turned out busted if they were strong enough ring a bell the cat needs to go,34
perkz bot are you trolling there s no way that would ever ever work bring back,16
zeus is too filthy,4
i feel like it s more likely that riot just transition to lans per year instead of,18
100t keeps getting flanked every fight did they forget how to play,13
yes so they need clg to tie with them to whoever theoretically loses between them if tsm 100t tie tl for 6th they are out unless clg is also tied for 6th with a way,34
kiin deserves an msi spot zeus kiin and theshy msi prayge,12
item on hit effects don t get reduced no matter how they re applied none of the bonus damage procs is tagged as attack damage so tabis does not interact with it that s the status quo,33
i m gonna be the odd man out and say that the emotes are very underwhelming i thought the emotes would look like the players themselves but it just ended up being league characters that don t really represent any sort of emotion,41
don t think adc would be enough but if you swap bot lanes sure,13
fr nothing will be lost even lore wise or the problem that we lost cool character its just a fckin cat,21
bamboozle banboozle,3
tf is also dogshit right now,6
he hasn t posted commented in this sub for a few months now wonder why,13
bds and astralis they choose there oponents from there group astralis had the choise fnc or mad and chose fnc and bds could chose sk between koi and sk,29
malrang hmm today i will play ultimate bravery,8
it s so so nice to see an na team play early aggro comps and actually succeed with them makes me a wee bit hopeful for msi,26
i dont care about a rookie choking his first stage game but rekkles has been a disaster every tf,19
ah yes the shuffle of shame,6
lets say it by the name he did write some nasty comments to an underaged girl thats why fnc understandably removed him,22
frankie is out there killing this man jankos can t just get a break even out of the rift,18
looks like you need more help week on stage week from home he went wouldn t say he s a god off of stage game he s not inting but to each their own week from home,40
spongebob would hop on squidward s account after squidward explains how hard league is and climb to challenger with with skarner in minutes,23
for what it s worth i play normal draft with friends fairly often my games are way more consistent than doing solo ranked,23
dw reverse sweep,3
keep doing these awesome skits and content brought a nice smile and laugh to the start of the series,19
letalithy sion had lower winrate than tank sion last patch so i don t think he s any relevant,18
i wanted thanatos he s clear of burden chasy and probably canna too maybe too early to promote but if we don t he s going somewhere else for sure,27
looll more kass items nerfs after they gutted the champ because of these items classic riot,16
you didn t mention twohoyrz who is instrumental in gameward wins together with his top and jungle really underated player and big champion pool,23
edg aphelios also goes hard,5
if you let your opp laner go then you dont deserve to win in the first place,18
i mean lmao but why tho,6
he s on tank duty because he was hard inting on anything not named gragas or sion,16
dude what the fuck i thought telecom wars were dead,10
he replied to me asking about tie breakers it was not the joke,13
person you are replying to is likely toxic af in game and got restricted lmao,15
an aoe cleanse seems like a complete cock block against hard engage press r teams,14
first time seeing this definitely happened many times before,9
cap s dad in audience its over for mad,8
hell yeah they will pls don t crash and burn in playoffs,11
eg looses to dig and beats fly what at team,10
its actually weird how you say she is getting no flame to a guy who is literally saying she should get fired,22
id rather have more build and role diversity than be forced to play marksmen when i go botlane,18
man i love drakos and caedrel,6
wow supports having scope to support their team and help their deficiencies crazy concept this is literally the point of the game its a team game you draft to cover weakness and accentuate strengths you can make this comment about anything,41
that was so horrible,4
i break her nose with the banhammer whenever i play top only way i can avoid further erosion of my sanity,21
it s okay not to like someone just don t spread lies to push your viewpoint man,15
someone said that mad wasn t even top last week literally weeks after being in the finals,18
reminded me of miguel from coco,6
doesn t matter the only thing that matters is keria being the clear carry of that team,16
good thing they won t have to play draven s hans until summer,11
that is literally how counterplay works for every single champion in the game you ain t winning against a perfectly played ezreal either and due to yuumi passive it is impossible to play yuumi effectively without detaching and getting into enemy range,41
you dont get it chairs are wooden and have four legs they re a table by that logic,17
wow this guy is the last thinking league player,9
instakok songs,2
man got hit with that negative 1k karma overnight,9
gamers tm momento,2
everyone i want every single character to join this silly ass pool party,13
i though she was supposed to walk like a wind up toy,11
yuumi is mostly because of what her fantasy allows her a magic book so she has that open ended going for her if anything she doesnt even really have cat themed abilities just magic book,35
gabby better not be casting next week after another shit performance today,12
oh yeah,2
oner and faker had no kp for the first mins but their map movements literally won the game off of these dive threats,25
x has really high highs but really low lows,9
yes plz,2
i hope eg s ceo nicole la point jameson gets fired absolutely disgusting the way she treated danny,17
no man you don t understand a winners mentality is when you put your whole team on tilt by flaming them and a losers mentality is when you try to avoid that,31
if everyone is doing it then being that good is still impressive,12
but thats not really a practical use case though you cant really plan on saving your tf ult just for akali s shroud in teamfights,24
if a teammate is playing a champ on day one and they get mad they re selfish and didn t want to win that bad anyway,24
yeah i remember him getting a coach too but not sure if that s just the mandela effect,17
they inflate lp gain this season but they din not inflate mmr gain so the discrepancy will be worse den before,21
mad had the cho mid,5
gg wins more than games challenge impossible,8
the adc main is probably the most skilled in the lobby in micro play though,15
surely we use our import slots to improve the top lane pool not to make it worse,17
riven stun reset minion aggro,5
yeah og faker nidalee and leblanc clips were the dumbest shit to watch,13
like perkz and hans sama amirite,6
never understood why it even has to be that long just make it instant,14
closer bjergsen on that one and then tenacity griefed tp down get instagibbed and let ksante get massive farm lead but they get the heist perfect team fight strategy of realizing that jojo is the sole dmg threat,39
i m glad i m not the only one who does this with the snipping tool lmao,15
that s me,2

senna needs a bucket and a mop for this wet ass support,12
ksante is such a skill gap champion it s hard to know when he s actually bad or if the person playing him is just bad at playing him,27
because it s almost like she s had a massive impact on the balance and development of the game recently so people are feeling the effects of the champion and she s on the forefront of their minds whenever they go in game,40

another argument gender and sex are not the same thing yea chromosomes can t be changed but that would be changing sex we re talking about gender here a socially constructed identity that can be altered transgressed or disregarded,37
you look really really stunning op your smile is really pretty,12
the one thing i agree with is no p there have been multiple attempts to add a p to the acronym but not for pansexual for pedophile in an attempt to simultaneously legitimise pedophilia and delegitimise queer people,39
which end being the same thing because mediocre will never do anything about evil,14
fuck yeahh,2

well great thing there isnt a man in that dress but seriously i wish you the best if people are treating you poorly for wearing what you like,28
maybe yr just h rny and he s cute omg i love this thanks,12
you both got the goth gf and became the goth gf you won the jackpot,15
i don t know but i hate the sound of it,10
this is weirdly the most wholesome thing i ever saw the post,12
hey beautiful,3
idk about you but when my platonic pals die the thought of their genitalia being gone from this world doesn t move me to tears just saying,26
the only way is to fight back and to hopefully win,11
tik tok is the worst when it comes to this infighting discourse shit i had to uninstall it just to get away from the exhausting twenty somethings who do nothing but sit around and create discourse,34
i like the idea but it feel like appropriation especially considering it omits the new colors of the progress flag,20
you are there just add black stockings or fishnets and ta da,13
well as op says they re agender so op kinda already answered that one for you,15
congrats and hope you have a nice day too,9
i think you d be largely unaware of the many banned and suspended accounts no,14
they are most definitely not,5
i agree they are a good couple,7
assigned cool at birth,5
happy tdov your make up is so good,8
i thought the plane did that,6
exactly,2
unfortunately politics doesn t work that way easy lol not to mention we need to make reforms for lgbtq ppl already in the united states especially within states like florida and texas,31
usually i m like ooh i ship it or not my ship but it s cute or not my otp but i like it or ugh that s my notp no matter the gender identities of the characters,35
why is it important to you that he accept the label of gay,13
do you think he could ve added you by mistake sounds like it,12
you say that but considering the impact its having on our legislation i beg to differ,16
this sounds like life goals for everyone cis or trans keep up the good work,16
yahh glad you recognized me thank you,8
i tried to but it didn t work at the time i thought i was panromantic and heterosexual but now i ve realized i m actually trans amp lesbian probably that s the reason,30
fawn is a very gentil sounding name while mazie has a bit more attitude to it,16
fuck yeah i welcome you,5
this is super cute and lovely support,7
trans rights are human rights,5
is she the one that got done for trafficking children edit it appears to be christina alicia lynch gdc id four counts of trafficking and prostituting children,28
nice smile,2
thank you so much they re definitely one of my favorite pairs,12
phenomenal,1
jaja no que mucha gente que lo era,11
shoot they re onto me,4
we need to make it a circle though so it doesnt have straight sides,14
it does but for legality reasons it s probably the best choice you gotta save you re own butt ya know,18
others feel differently but queer is my preferred term it s common enough in academic writing that it can t reasonably be considered an exclusive endonym at this point,27
i really like that if you get any i hope you enjoy it lt,14
it s not weird you ll find yourself in good company,9
no one should be forced to come out ever it was heinous i do think the underlying reasons behind it weren t addressed though,23
aww is that a k shirt i see,8
first stage denial i have the same opposite thing i wish i was a boy and i feel like a boy,21
as a bi sexual i rather date a woman or a man i don t get upset i basically invisible to woman mostly white woman and that is ok,30
i ve been fretting about this all morning this is wonderful news an important excerpt yousaf has promised to see through a legal challenge against the uk government s decision to block scotland s gender recognition reform img emote,35
why would they take down something they hung up in the first place,13
not mad just bad timing to be out and about,10
ahh yes the flag representing the land of people who would watch hours of lord of the ring extended edition rather than have sex i love that country they make great bread and cake no shitty remarks here unlike some,41
lt,1
gay train d,3
that is great and yes doing well on this end,10
you two are lovely thanks for sharing this happiness thrilled you are able to have such a wonderful memorable time,20
oh my god you look stunning great job,8
i think you could say anyone who can get pregnant or people person i m suggesting this bc sometimes i even don t like person with a uterus as a trans guy,29
it was close to sinful they almost committed a sin they were this close but they didn t,17
i think it s a twisted way of putting down anyone who stands up for the rights of others they can t just say you re bad because you care about people so they created a code for it,36
it not political it s called being a decent human being,10
zie do you like identify as german or sum,9
that s a really cute outfit,5
is it i can t see it lol i find it like the frog is like holding the flag away from it,21
may i ask what caedsexual is i ve never heard of the term before,13
yeah indeed they are but i don t use them as rules but thank you for point it out,18
yo mister white do you support trans rights,8
i guess i m stuck with ads oh cruel fate gif giphy uf8y1ige8xwxq,10
too kind sending love,5
you look cute although i think there s too much pattern i think you should keep one pattern one plain or graphic t shirt,22
yea but the only one i ve seen on toh is some background characters during grom,15
my wife and i started watching forged in fire a bunch and we had a friend that was a smith as a hobby so we asked for lessons and kinda just went from there bought our own equipment and everything,40
,1
does she agree with anything else shapiro says,8
mom said it s my turn on the trans right,9
i have a penis still i m a lesbian and trans,10
oh i see thanks,4
mine isn t there lmao,5
sorry i m used to people coming on here and being like they re all the same thing which really bothers me,20
you rose to the occasion,5
don t worry they keep making sure child marriage stays legal gotta protect those kids,14
comforting someone hitting on them apparently,5
thank you and it s mostly the light doing some work it s mostly reddish blonde except my mustache that didn t get the memo lmao,23
oh awesome paper mario is great,6
there is also an article by the times calling demisexual people attention seekers and matt walsh a very well known terf also started attacking the ace community so there are also corporations and well known people after us rn,39
letsgoo,1
they meant him as in batman i think,8
i will sticking with partner sounds like a good idea thanks,11
i love how all the others are so derpy and then the non binary one is just like,18
yes u s sorry i will fix it,7
i m sorry what fugitive slave act anyone the state can going to other free states to kidnap kids this whole thing reminds me a lot of pre civil war america,30
as a bisexual person i don t think it s cringe you are straight i assume sorry if i m wrong and you are an ally to those who are not i think it s just meant to be catchy,36
not to mention the dialogue sounds very idk how to put it reddit y like it just sounds like something someone made up for karma or sympathy,26
plenty green hair offended by everything make gender their entire personality think gender isn t real always afab teenagers covered in pronoun pins obsessed with flags tiktok and anime,28
i have beliefs that prevent me from serving or caring about what bigoted holes want,16
i don t live in the us but i will absolutely vote for queer friendly parties in my country when i turn,22
heckin cutie,3
the more modern use is non men loving non men,8
aww you look great,4
i think its the lgbt flag with bad lighting,9
yeah but i find that a happy woman is a more attractive woman that is one happy lady,19
lmao how did that happen i hope you kept it because it s probably the spitting image of the totk broken master sword lolol,23
you have beautiful eyes,4
aw hell nah,3
agree it s just that they told me i was sensitive when i spoke out about it,16
all my homies hate the transphobes,6
because women haven t been the ones overseeing the systematic dismantling human rights and the perpetuation of a toxic culture this is not to say that no women are involved just that there s a reason it s called the patriarchy,38
i agree it s the heterosexual men looking at the drag queens sexually that makes it about sex for them even if it wasn t mean t that way at all that s how they see it,33
if you really can t call him a he and use his preferred name warn him and try to not use any pronouns with him as much as possible,28
is that two cases of red bull,7
russia can have florida if they want,7
my dms are open to anyone who needs to talk vent or anything,13
ooh that sounds adorable,4
for real most doctors are so cis and heteronormative i had to fill out a form about my parents and instead of it saying parent and parent or anything inclusive it literally only said mother and father,39
it s nice you wanna help them but frankly they should be allowed to come out on their own terms,19
that s married gras in most of the rest of the world luv amd elsewhere there s not even that nor karneval,20
wtf that s not okay think about what you just said is it homophobic to punish people for anything i consider to be associated with homosexuality gtfoh,26
ok if so go for that d i mean if they know the folks are good with it that this will be something their parents are gonna find hilarious and its gonna be a welcomed fun thing that sounds great,40
this i feel the same,6
was this for lgbtq history month,6
agreed it s performative and puts trans people in the very awkward situation of outing themselves before they might be ready people need to take actual action,26
thanks for the info,4
someone must have told him a joke but i don t hear one,12
ask them why it s work inappropriate in writing such as an email unless there is explicit material in there which i m guessing is a no there isn t an answer they can give that isn t an hr issue,37
weird how that works,5
your mum is entirely wrong you are loved,8
wow my jaw dropped your beautiful,8
it s not just an excuse for islamophobia it s an actual study the comments might get disgusting there but i don t see why that means we can t have an actual conversation here,31
exactly people just want an excuse to ignore what is actually going on they don t care until it effects them directly,21
ohh that makes it make sense,6
yeah sea is practically dangerous for lgbt in general,9
this is highly inaccurate enough so that it may put people in danger,13
double good choice,3
grats good luck,3
mazie but i definitely feel like your name would be a month ex august june,15
i changed my first middle and last name went scorched earth on that mofo,14
ohh understood i m trans too but haven t looked into the name change stuff much have never heard of a passport card only the book,24
pronouns aren t names though they re more generalized they them can be used for men women both or neither if pronouns become as specified as names they just become secondary names which kinda defeats their purpose in the first place,38
i could not disagree more but that is a discussion for another day,13
absolutely but this sort of message helps shake the fence sitters to their senses after they get barraged by alarmist nonsense from right wingers,23
the lack of self awareness when she talks about how others shouldn t force their beliefs onto others is so common among christians,21
you absolutely don t have to be sorry everyone has days when they need a hug or at least a virtual one its not selfish to need cheering up it s human especially with so much trash going on right now,40
helluva boss,2
of course you re valid it s okay to be attracted to different people in different ways and it s also okay if you have a long label i do too you are always valid lt,33
then i don t understand why you re even replying to me,10
how do you even disagree with it it s like flat earthers who disagree with the earth being spherical ish,19
pansexual isn t accurate at all because then i d be saying that i m also attracted to men which i hate the thought of because i m not at all i m attracted to non men,32
this is unwise perhaps just tuck your hair up into a hat if you want short hair i did that for years and it worked well worked even better after i gave myself a slight undercut,36
yeah i ve had that experience with this whole being trans thing so many terms to learn and so many terms to abandon due to then being wrong or straight up hateful,32
i recommend trying r wholesomememes very kind community with pleasant memes,10
well sadly it doesn t appear until the fourth season but disenchantment has lesbians,13
i don t know what you re referring to but it could be,11
the terms are not gendered it sounds like you may think they are,13
they are a group of cishet people pretending to be us,11
there s a difference between sexual attraction i would sleep with them and aesthetic attraction they are fucking stunning,18
well i am a gay woman and all i will endeavor to change it and thank you my brother your trans sister thanks you,24
something luz noceada would wear,5
so represents me the line between neutrois and agender is fluid,10
voidpunk,1
no you are not a feminist you idiotic terf you are a fascist,13
one of the best things i ve ever seen,8
they re the same people who claim the left bans everything they don t like while the right calls for freedom they re such obvious hypocrites,23
i remember that episode,4
yes they re mad and scared because drag is a critique on the gender binary the image above enforces that binary by mocking women and gender non conforming people,27
aww thank you,4
wlw are wlw lol,4
and you ll have relatives on facebook saying you know he makes a good point,14
vote for her next election or donate to her campaign,10
yes the only confirmed polysexual character is kaldur ahm from young justice,11
i think it s just an extension of the terf ideology bioessentislism sad it s been catching on in so many spaces,20
what a bag of smashed assholes,6
i totally deserved that,5
w gif emote,1
why don t they do something that actually makes sense and take children away from parents who take them to a catholic church,22
i can t tell if it s giving overzealous well meaning allies who tried but overshot it or lazy half assed attempt at inclusion by someone who just copy pasted the most diverse sounding list they could find,35
i thought it was slenderman at first,7
ya know ing mxself extensively during puberty helped build my stamina a lot higly recommend even after puberty,17
pretty cool,2
gt i don t see why there are homophobic trans people and transphobic gay people because you don t get to choose to be queer but you sure can choose to be a shitbag,32
i m ready to fucking throw hands with that governor not actually just mentally,13
a similar law passed in tennessee only the tennessee one is worse,12
i recognize the lgb alliance but what s the one below it,11
im in canada but still thinking about getting training anyway one day if my mental health permits it,18
me an american being shocked we ve had even one trans parliament member and then remembering it s called congress and we dont have anything called parliament,25
neat how i happen to have a trans friend named sky,11
thank youu i wish you good mental health i am glad aww art what art are you creating,18
honestly i feel bad about it but as a trans woman i would feel very uncomfortable in lesbian spaces maybe even more so than if it was just straight cis people around,32
well maybe that was a little more useful in the 1700s but that s still one more language you know over me,21
yep the q also stands for questioning,8
yeah that last one is a mystery to me dating a trans man somehow feels more gay to me than dating a cis man,24
would wear would fuck would swoon,7
your dad seems like he d be a right laugh as a drinking buddy i like him,17
thank you for your support,5
old friends nickname for me lols just kept it,9

in my city cologne germany cis hetero men in skirts are not out of the norm sometimes i m jealous of how good some men look wearing them d,29
homophobes are secretly gay just like klansmen are secretly black s,11

i think you look like you are working as a dj in am underground club i mean that as a compliment,21
we have not been there so we cannot judge it is allways ok to make an honest mistake and say sorry it is not ok to to this in purpose,30
my best friend got a new haircut that gives him gender euphoria he looks so handsome,17
imma move to another country when i can,8
oh yeah this is accurate the bi erasure struggle is real,11
same lmaoo i even like drag but i d probably have a panic attack if forced to have a one on one conversation with a queen i feel so bad about it lol,32
it is a great outfit,5
your makeup looks lovely you certainly caught me honey,10
why are you hateing and homophobic,6
ohh thank you her unending lies of matt walsh video popped up in my feed but i havent had the time to watch it totally will tho tysmm well i have had the time but the video is just so long,41
it is fair that she is uncomfortable probably because she isnt used to it but that doesn t mean you shouldn t be allowed to use the women s bathroom,27
you know i was thinking about this the other day i thought are they gonna ban tyler perry s stuff mrs doubtful etc i just remembered undersiege had a drag moment too,34
i am just going to judge anyone intentinally however it is spelled dropping the t,14
to be fair he also doesn t support trump or most of these other extremist republican conservatives i don t talk much politics with my dad even so personally he doesn t care whether people are lgbtq or not,36
and they just think the blue and pink flag is pretty a reasonable conclusion,14
just call them a shit head or a dumb fuck those are pretty gender neutral,15
these are frequently traps depending on the company,8
america bffr,2
yeah that s why like of the things in these comments won t really work since everyone is either transphobic or doesn t care from the top of my head i only know like people that would care,37
lotsa people don t like it you are still misgendering someone if they don t like those pronouns,16
the prefix poly comes from a greek word so i think the pi is just the first letter of that word,21
weighted stone pressure plate j,5
das ist gut das merke ich mir danke freundlicher redditor vergessen sie nicht aufzunehmen,16
minnesota s governor made an executive order to protect trans healthcare access in the state also canada has an ongoing petition to allow trans americans to seek asylum in canada,29
thank you so much,5
username checks out,3
thanks for the education on that i d have no idea otherwise as it s not heard of in my area of the uk,22
polysexuals together strong,3
your smile says everything you are being yourself with confidence and happiness best wishes to you,16
i can t tell if this is wholesome a shitpost or hilarious or all of them but i love it,19
except for partners of trans people who have been shamed beaten and even killed,14
i can kind of relate to that i don t know what s up with that as in what is causing this but it feels confusing because i m not sure if this is something purely sexual or something that relates to gender identity,41
,1
it s not transphobic it s worse it s like hitting someone below the belt on purpose during a boxing match they are assholes and spiteful people but it s not about being trans it s about hitting you where it hurts,37
ty,2
yeah i hated reading this,5
big duh moment,3
why do the eyes of the top left character look so weird,12
capitalism is the reason it took til the 200s before we had that level of technology,16
bubblegum punk is a thing,5
so he really can t date and is going to die a virgin good for the gene pool,17
cause in a patriarchal society people are gonna be told that god is a man furthermore most religious people will just listen to what they re told so they won t do the research themselves and do about seconds of critical thinking,41
if she touches you a lot,6
very sweet thank you,4
good convo both of you had valid points expressed them well then agreed to disagree and decoupled nah,19
because nobody chooses to be queer nobody chooses to have their family turn against them and the people around them ostracize them random strangers harass them or even want to hurt them what makes you think it might be a choice,41
i m an anticapitalist antiauthoritarian the rest is kinda just wishful thinking given the society we work in unless you re involved in talking about theory on a daily basis i don t see much utility in drawing a particular line beyond that tbh,41
thank you the middle part and the underskirt was from amazon and the overalls skirt was from hot topic,20
it s not limiting for me because i love female friendships enough that i could live without romantic ones,18
could someone remake this a bit more colorblind friendly gradients especially from red to green are very hard for some of us,22
oo pretty girl,3
i stole mine from the land improvement contractors of america because that s the first thing that comes up when you look up lica,23
ron white is also an ally especially for trans rights,10
some people have multiple flags in their user flair don t know how to tho and thats also what the op is wondering,22
being in the community doesn t exempt someone from bigotry unfortunately u deserve better,14
desantis can kiss my desantass,5
i d say you re in too deep now to hide it any longer ask her on a date if it goes well tell her it s better to be rejected sooner rather than later in my opinion,35

please god no i don t want those assholes in my community,11
i use blonde as a default neutral spelling blond just doesn t look right to me it doesn t look like a real word,21
thank you,3
actually when you use the b word not as a gender neutral term that s when i find it to be insulting and unacceptable,23
thx most of my art is really bad though this just happened to turn it really well,19
oh fuck sake this is americas priorities the fuck are they gonna do when they achieve their goal of ridding minorities try rule over the other states seriously wtf is the point,32
damn you are cute,4
gotta love cishets who want representation even though they get it all day every day in such subtle ways that they don t even notice they re being represented which culminates in them wanting representation,33
in this country wanting not to infringe on other people s lives and choices is being leftist it s unfortunate but that s kind of where they drew the line,27
looking cute gif emote grin img emote img emote,3
very true there s definitely safety in numbers,7
do it man we don t own the rainbow just be prepared for folks to ask about it from time to time i d think,23

assistant to the,4
hey dad i m gay,4
traditionally masculine i believe but one of those i think could pass for unisex i like it i think it s a cute name,23
the government should be focusing on more important issues like outlawing friendships in our schools evrey year millions of children are brainwashed by these so called friends,27
i didn t expect this to get so many comments,10
i was gonna say they haven t been on twitter,9
huh you re not comfortable around gay guys that have sex with their boyfriends sounds very homophobic,16
this guys comics crack me up he has a whole subreddit i think,13
emm i ve seen related concepts on youtube before i vaguely remember that means female to queer,15
oh yeah it s terrible and terrifying,6
aww thanks,2
oh lol that s fair can i ask why cause it s harry potter and jk is a horrible person,18

thank you thank you,6
queen,2
had to go back to check and now i have to force myself to not lol in class,19
i ll be carrying my this pride month because this is the first time in a long time i ve actually felt unsafe as an openly gay person,27
i understand that but i m unsure if i m in love or my brain is making me think that because of the lack of physical contact yk,25
i feel sad that this feels fake to me only because i ve been around poopy people for a long time i need to continually remind myself that there are better places to find better situations to exist in,38
desantis is watching uganda right now,6
i think i was kicked out of my family for suggesting god was a woman too many christians are simply immature patriarchal knobs who weaponise their beliefs to pretend they own morality,32
it s not a new thing though they hate trans people then they use them as votebanks i indeed agree with you how messed up it is,26
once again my home state being awesome i love living in minnesota,12
i m confused by this and i want to understand in my mind femininity is inherently tied to girl and girl is inherently tied to femininity i m having trouble understanding what you mean by one without the other,37
gt brotherhood of evil i genuinely wouldn t be surprised if they just came out and announced the rebrand,17
thank you after some sleep i posted this very late at night for me and re reflection i think i m realizing that i might have always felt this way even before my previous relationship,34
not worth it don t be hard on yourself things will get better have faith in yourself,16
what about healthcare for a disabled person,7
that s beautiful w dad,4
my cup is just a bunch of furrys and military stuff and i fucking love it,16

the problem is that they will fear monger people into making reports by threatening them with jail even if they re not doing that now or saying they will do it they will most certainly try to do that in the future,41
he may just be bisexual with a low sex drive really the only way to know anything is to talk to him and if he doesn t know than to wait it out,32
omg stoopp am not,5
dunno looks like you re doing it already,7
not to mention what he is doing to disney world,10
not even close,4
you both look hot cries in single lesbian,8
why not both,3
even in safe states hate crimes have increased such as the club a shooting last year in colorado you have to be willfully dense not to recognize the us has become increasingly dangerous to the lgbtqia community,37
it s a horror game lmao,5
right it s such a fun color palette and a neat aesthetic i jump between my clothes and their aesthetics a lot but this one is definitely super fun,28
wouldn t be the first time he makes poor decisions fracking in his backyard doubling down on anti trans stances fuelled by prejudgement,23
you being attracted to women and being a trans woman doesn t mean you re going to watch her or be weird so i d guess she s a transphobe and lesbophobe who thinks far too highly of herself and sees you as less than,41
i could be better wbu,5
op is a terf op is a terf op is a terf why the f isn t this downvoted more,19
thank you very much,6
this is so fucking well written omg,7
tyy,2
university of minnesota recognizes it and uses the acronym 2slgbtqia,10
i would say to take a stop on things and talk to a gender therapist and a gender professional i will mention i m not trans but i do research on gender issues and gender medical care,36
i hope more liberals move there to swing the state back can t count on republicans to change anytime soon,19
that definitely didn t warrant a removal by reddit i thought it would be something outrageous,15
thank you for sharing and your english is great do you know where i can find this show,19
daniil dankovsky vibes for some reason,6
thank you,3
lmaoo i m trying haha very good bullying btw,8
yeah not all cops are terrible the sro at my school is a genuinely cool dude but it s unfortunate because a lot of cops are terrible people we need more like these two in our law enforcement system,38
marie is super cute,4
in that case don t mind a label and just go with whoever you feel queer works fine but if you find a micro label you like better use that,29
you know how hulu has no ads well the joke is that there is apparently lgbt and than you got lgbt without the ads,24
thank you i m going to use those examples to show them it s possible i hope it counts,17
wear some rainbow pride paraphernalia things like pins hats watch bands clothes stickers make a point of showing it off hopefully they connect the dots,25
my misogyny has nothing to do with my transition jk but fr tho i would just ignore them unless they re actually looking for more knowledge and not just a fight the convo will go nowhere,35
hot,1
and then it will get appealed all the way to the supreme court alito will cite some shit written in the 12th century to explain why stuff like this does not violate interstate commerce law,35
if i had a word with your dad i d tell him he should be eager to fly your flag if he really is trying it won t bother him that much,30
as a straight man i would never be able to tell you re trans you pass with flying colors my man,20
that is very true like i understand that not every sexuality can be explained in detail but they could ve at least mentioned the difference between sexual and romantic attraction,29
that s such a look you are perfect,9
of course stay strong stay proud and most importantly stay positive,11
dammnn you are soo cute,5
sometimes it feels like gay men are more dangerous than cishet men,12
voting will not save us at this point all it does is legitimize the governmental structure of a failed state stop telling people to give their power over to others,30
,1
as a jewish trans person and a historian yeah we re either about to hit stage or somewhere in range of depending on which of the particularly anti trans us states you re in,33
ain t no way my trans brain getting gender envy from a bee,13
you would think america would be beyond that but some in america love ultra conservative shit it s a real mind fuck living in america,22
why do we need any other kind of shows and events for children,13
is it ok if i send u a message,9
i m a queer libertarian and apart of libertarianism is everyone minding their business,13
you look so cute,4
that s really beautiful,4
honestly it s such a stupid word people say it when lgbt people are poorly and forcefully pushed into media but when it s done well as with any form of good media assholes pretending not to be assholes still call it woke,41
i read that title as some mf suggested i try a goth look let this be a lesson to not listen to music while reading things,26
you look absoloutely stunning i love your eyes also you kind of remind me of tara maclay from buffy the vampire slayer,23
anyone know something in nc piedmont area,7
what was the book called,5
i truly hate that this is a fact and that every gay or trans person that joins the hate train of the gop is their mascot until it doesn t benefit them,31
thank you but do you think you can be aromantic and bi or am i likely just bi and haven t met the right person,24

big maple syrup is just big sugar but wet,9
she literally tried to break down the doors of the house letting in a murderous bunch of domestic terrorists the officer who shot her is an absolute hero and nobody should remember the dead woman s name,36
cold feet received blackmail,4
just maybe desantis gets the nomination and trump goes independent and the red votes split giving us more years of biden,22
called the gop investigation implosion as soon as they won the house i can t wait until they bring up the afghanistan withdrawal stuff i mean getting out is a winner and free advertising for biden s re election,36
start a serious buy back program mandatory registration mandatory safe storage similar to sweden when someone dies his or her guns must be turned in all gun owners must yearly take a gun certification course that includes a mental wellness check,41
i feel like they re pretty mask off now with all the xianity based legislation blowing up everywhere and the naked xian ness of the dobbs decision that ruling actually violates the religious freedom of conservative jews but who cares we re scotus suck it,40
they lost their female chief risk officer and didn t replace her and had nearly a year of mismanaged risk,19
i suspect ol tuck comes up short in many aspects of his life,13

we know you useless twat,5
he has completely killed his own soul he s going the way of gollum,13
not an ounce of sympathy for anyone willing to work there not one,13
it s really not crazy because those companies are subject to us jurisdiction tiktok s parent company is an agent of the chinese communist party all chinese companies are agents of the government of china that s how it works there,38

gt single fucking one of you need to vote in the next election not just the next presidential election or state governors but in every election at every level,28
i agree judge the work by the content not the name of it if you wrote a great book and put some of the shit that s in the bible in there those folks wouldn t want you to show it to kids,41
ah yes boycotts why can t democrats try fighting for people using checks notes their positions in government,17
i know all this cuz of an indictment of just one of the pending investigations their heads will explode bigly if when he gets convicted lol,25
can we get a real source on this,8
so if i would like to raise concerns awareness for these issues at another possibly smaller paper how would i do that,21
when they started to work it out and correct themselves i was a tiny bit disappointed as was basically everyone in congress lol everyone hates ted cruz,27
and rampant alcoholism,3
it s funny because he s a cripple,7
yeah that s what i figured just one of a bunch of stuff conservatives all over the country have had on the back burner for decades waiting for the sc to have a conservative majority,34
gt there s a collective action problem the operative explained because none of the major candidates consultants or donors will want to put their own self interest aside not amongst republicans i refuse to believe it,33
there is more to that string of letters now i hear,11
no i m saying wb might get to keep the hp theme park stuff buying the ip doesn t necessarily mean getting the theme park rights,24
i have a pretty high threshold,6
jail isn t the worst punishment for trump his supporters becoming indifferent to him would be far far worse,18
i hope so and biden is going to bring down the hammer on these bastards,15
gt very few other communities go around forcing their beliefs on others there are plenty of other countries that do this too,22
love that this just came out and we get this great new nickname,13
yes please,2
he s got all the frothing mouthed degenerates already i doubt it helps him much at all i recall them saying this about impeachment too the gop have lost every election cycle since,33
gt i m starting to think where have you been,8
fox is the biggest network because they get all the conservatives plus a ton of democratic hate clicks,18
let me guess the pay doesn t reflect the degree either,10
trump only won wyoming and nd by votes much smaller amount could have a huge impact i know alaska is even closer,23
someone should go share this in r conservative and r libertarian i would but i m banned in both,16
there are other investigations w much worse crimes,9
becaues tucker carlson disingeniously puts it on during a moment of breaking news,14
this feels so so right what a historical moment,9
did anyone expect this to play out any differently,9
do you think they d give a month window to back alley drug dealers to offload their stock of drugs first,21
not a peep from taibbi greenwald musk etc,8
so much bs with this both parties are the same mentality,11
the posting of this article to the forum is redundant and old news the ny da is no longer asking but has gotten his grand jury to indict trump,29
right which gets to my next pet peeve all the tax free wealth within churches and virtually zero giving to the poor in the community how are they nonprofit when most do actually profit,31
the primary factors contributing to trans suicidality are lack of access to transitioning and mental healthcare lack of acceptance from family and community violence and abuse and poverty,28
to play the confidence game at the highest levels you have to go so deep you believe the story you crafted,21
so what you are saying is of one person commits a crime you convict everyone who happens to walk by,20
it s only going to be that i m not really expecting any truth from it and we re probably not going to any because these people have lied in the past and they ll do that again,34
you might wanna check out gerald horne s counter revolution of he s a historian at university of houston his work is very readable and digestible and very rich in information,29

it s about damn time,4
i hate to tell you this but it s was super common in the 70s lol it was this world and in the usa and outside out the usa it was even more common,33
it won t be gilead until they regain control of the white house sometime whether in or not and pass all of this into federal law which is absolutely the end goal,32
exactly they always place their own in protests to make everyone else look bad,14
have you seen where their current investigations are going,9
ronnie doesn t know his cops are getting hot at the body shop,12
time for desantis the duck to make his debut in the new disney short mallards make me moan,18
the primaries haven t been held unless the gop is doing away with them for the election he s nothing but a candidate,22
this is very harsh criticism from warren,7
ok pro lifers where s your defense of this bill usually see one of you praising stuff like this in the first to comments are you ok with governmental control of a woman s body,34
mother has put her foot down this time,8
considering this is something that has never happened in us history before i d say something already is happening,18
yahtzee finally now the actual wheels of justice can be put into motion guilty or not this is what is supposed to happen,23
catch me if you can,5
using campaign funds to pay stormy s hush money,8
i wouldn t know but limiting what we can see on the internet beyond a certain point is exactly something a dictatorship would do,23
i wonder if it s possible for sanders to do more than calling for something maybe if he was one of those people i think they call them santas or sentros or something like that,34
gt i m not sure what florida thought they were going to do extort them what else,16
google florida senate bill,5
you don t get to invade a country in steal land then only decide to end the war if you get to keep part of the land you stole,29
so amend it again,4
prepare to vote if desanitizer wins too,7
what bad things are described in gender queer sex oh heaven forbid,12
gt hrt is reversible you meant puberty blockers i believe hrt can certainly cause irreversible effects which is why it s not an option until the late teens or beyond after other extensive and more reversible treatments,35
not likely twitter and reddit opinions don t reflect the real world,11
uh most of the eu has also banned them,9
this like when i m watching ancient aliens and the narrator says ancient alien theorists suggest,15
that decision has been all but overturned,7
gt what even is woke anymore it was never a thing it never had a solid definition,16
this fact does not need to be buried down,9
buying tbills woke got it,6
if they were smart they d back desantis as he is much more effective than trump fortunately they re not smart,19
what the fuck,3
fox puts him on the phone with an intern in a cubicle,12
good on him we need to invest in our next generation give these kids a chance less billionaires and stronger families,21
gt we re fighting the return of fascism we are the fascists appear to be winning unopposed right now,18
they invest in the economy with that wealth literally the opposite of hoarding weirdo if they were actually hoarding their wealth it wouldn t be growing the way it is lol,30
also randy savage s voice hulkamania is like a single grain of sand in the sahara desert that is macho madness,20
common sense it s not even a poll of likely voters as for i mentioned it because his favorability has remained within a margin,25
you can make that transfer not allowed in your data privacy laws don t comply with data privacy laws get banned,21
well of course he won t the primary reason he s running is to stay out of prison,16
something something broken clocks,4
he s calling for the magarats to get out and protest his upcoming arrest aka repeat of jan pure drama queen and he plays it well,26

the gop is sexual assault cases all the way down,10
statistics suggest they are a pretty indicative sample of white rural non college educated boomers notallboomers,15
i find it interesting they never seem to recite these passages in church haha,14
no his followers have been pro russia this whole time it s been a republican talking point for a while they can t get those sweet sweet nra contributions without russia,28
yeah dont let the man suck all the air out of the room with bullshit it s the exact gameplan trump used,21
sweet you say,3
wow i m even dumber than i thought,7
fascist is trashiest,3
lolwut he literally has a highly watched cable news program that he gets paid millions on to spew this pro fascist shit,21
the spirit of democracy isn t rule of those who play by the rules it s rule of the majority period everyone gets a vote,23
sigh i should have never taken him to see the whiz,11
shame,1
i m jewish but taking every american school child to a concentration camp would be unbelievably expensive since they re all in europe i d settle for a halocaust museum but entirely agree with the overall sentiment,34
looks like pence has judased his maga christ,9
i don t know if you give mr potato head glasses and a mustache he could pass for teddy roosevelt,19
he can t win but the dems sometimes are so friggin good at losing that he could win i for one will not vote for biden again,26
semi fascism close to sinful what a shameful fucking coward doesn t have the courage to call things out directly,19
so stand against him coward,5
be smarter about it maybe stupid agents not withstanding,9
i would have respected him more to be leading the downfall of trump instead he waited til it was clear trump s downfall is happening and then spoke out dude has no personal conviction or spine,35
we could see far worse than j6,7
ashli babbitt the veteran turned traitor that fucked around and found out while trying to break into the capitol building that ashli babbitt,23
how sweet of you to say,6
sorry best i can do is sell you these overpriced bootstraps which will break the moment you try to use them to pull yourself up,25
it s about tiktok because the point of this is to redirect attention to a singular company rather than looking at a systemic problem that congress actively facilitates through legislating on behalf of their ip bankrollers rather than us,38
meaning the basic requirements of proving safe storage you can handle it etc it s also about militias not a personal right to carry but whatever,25
to the courts we go,5
while you are not wrong dude dug his own grave being his right hand man for all those years he knew he was selling his soul,26
hell yeah,2
gt i love how not having a gun hurts people far far more people are saved by having a gun than are killed with a gun every year,30
dude you re wasting to much air on this just raise your middle finger and move on like a proper new yorker,21

so you feel that dying children is acceptable,8
jesus what do they have like of these a year seems like every time i turn around there s a cpac going on,23
is she not a trans woman herself,7
experts stunned while sane americans are like what else is new,11
yes they don t want trump being cornered and the only option he has left to save his ass is roll on the whole gqp,24
behind the dumpster behind the dispensary,6
4chan already is they re obsessing over the shooter s shoes,9
so super duper background checks that go through the same shitty system that states don t report into sounds like a great plan,22
kinda like tyson closing plants recently less production employees lower quality increased margins,13
what about schmucker,3
it s a little bit funny but a lot scary how they try and abuse power they have no power in this,21
i m still waiting for trump to get busted for paying off a pornstar,13
some companies still do i worked my way up to principal level with no college and my company paid for me to get a bachelors and masters,27
someone needs to midjourney prompt trump tiny hands tiny handcuffs,10
not cringe at all and actually pretty hilarious,8
armed shooter on school campuses no danger here nothing we can do the gays oh we gotta eradicate these people they re a danger to our children s obviously,26
i m going to need a bigger popcorn pot there may even be a popcorn shortage,15
i saw a video of hitler playing with his niece and a dog there s no way he s the monster they make him out to be,25
not a chance in hell this moves forward they are playing to their base nothing more it s disgusting but it is what they do,24
sounds oddly similar to the jetsons with the flying cars and robot maids,13
because she s not going to label a group she s a member of as a terrorist organization heck i m surprised she didn t demand that proud boys get to sit in on committee meetings as a condition to mccarthy becoming speaker,39
shut down the entire country at this point demand change demand an assault weapons ban they are far too dangerous for civilians and only belong in the hands of cops,30
modern lessons can be so fun my asian history course assigned us recent speeches from abe shinzo and xi jinping as homework my reading and writing course taught an entire lesson on kellyanne conway,36
i never said it doesn t i was pointing out that automatic weapons are not the issue,16
spoiler alert ron isn t ready he is too woke,9
nature nova and secrets of the dead are good shows too,11
oh did you not know that if that suprises you try reading about deutsche bank without losing your mind,19
but he ll plead the fifth,6
picatinny rail cupholders and tactical meal trays ready to go,10
gt desantis has real issues to deal with like sending secret police to drag shows not to mention showing disney who really runs florida or so he thinks,28
i mean you could just set your flair to i m a bigot that also doesn t understand statistics it would save the rest of us normal people a lot of time reading your absolute bullshit,34
speaking from experience their parents and society traumatized them into never accepting their feelings or at least with being open about them otherwise i would have transitioned in the nineties,30
i think that s a very fair assessment i also think there was a not insignificant percentage of voters who voted for trump as a protest to hillary because they didn t think he would actually win,34
i think she is cocaine bear most days but she certainly dressed the part that night,16
he is the living of butthead,7
when they go low we go for the eyes,9
dems so smart tho,4
trust me i know i currently live in phillips,9
he s gonna have a party,5
unfortunately the warren base is almost exclusively the very highly educated want to see a warren like person in the white house we re going to need to expand college education first supremacists really don t like earned authority,37
at the checking notes gay lord national convention center let it sink in ed to clarify it just sounds woke af,19
who do you think will have the best lawyers in this conflict,12
wow points but the last are pretty much defense of a federal fiefdom note to those unwilling to pick the link it says nothing specific about a curriculum more about availability of education,35
jesus be like hey don t drag me into this i was against it from the start,16
when the corporate fiefdom is better for the people than the government,13
well that s a slippery slope and no way it wouldn t be abused,12
here s what i imagine me son has anyone ever offered you marijuana you know maryjane you know maryann minutes later you know reggie you know repollo,26
hands off my healthcare no not like that,10
mildly interesting but off topic for the sub,8

i m not gonna openly ask what state you live in but i ll ask that you investigate what the federal government does for your state,24
,1
he s the antichrist,3
they re all officially on crack my goodness,8
because sex is not protected by our constitution they can use sex discrimination to attack minority after minority without anyone realizing that they are next that is how fascism consumes until there is no majority left to fight them,39
you re the one misgendering jackass,5
so if you re a teen mom you cannot have an opinion on this wow,14
the party of trump should be eradicated,7
you never thought about drag queens until q told you to,11
i don t want to be that guy because i hate texas but they re one of the states that contributes more to the federal government than they take it s often at the detriment of their citizens but still,37
it s like when gqp meetings are gun free zones laws for thee not for me,15
desantis will not let trump surrender,6
there really shouldn t be a need to tiptoe around the issue at this point do or say nazi shit congrats you re a fucking nazi,24
well yeah those things are all highly regulated and we all know how trump felt about regulations,17
giuliani was pretty heavily involved in plan a as well,10
are they trying to save face and get in front of their previous lies or what was their goal with this whole bit,23
i feel like i remember a big email scandal like six or seven years back something something put hillary in jail something something idono so many terrible things have happened since then hard to remember,35
you re not allowed to harm children unless you do it in the name of god apparently,16
in america it s not existent because the two parties have done a masterful job of co opting every issue into either left or right,23
do they mean traitor ashli babbitt,6
americans after another shooting oh no anyway,7
it s scary cause if even of them are legit extremists that s still literal terrorist all over the country,20
exert dominance back you rub shoulders with self proclaimed nazis the more deadpan you can deliver it the better then just walk away,22
bloods stick with bloods,4
following cpac is probably not the key determinant of who is ignorant and who isn t i reckon those who follow cpac are a lot more ignorant than those who don t,30
in florida showing mental health struggles could get a child detained get you fired give you a hard time finding employment etc etc,23
as if republicans wouldn t do it if it benefits them they have broken every norm when it suits them,19
you think making colorful signs and shouting makes a difference how did the not my president portests go,18
the homeschool kids i have met have done quite well very small sample size though,15

gt their defenders never really had the will or motivation to fight the taliban taking over was not a motivation to fight for them therefore they chose the taliban you admit it in your own comment,36
